<abstract>In this paper, we propose a pixel isolated liquid crystal (PILC) display using prepolymers containing bi-component acrylate monomers. The phase separation behavior and polymer wall structure of PILC were closely related to the solubility parameter and surface free energy of acrylate monomers. The polymer wall structure of bi-component prepolymers was readily controlled by the composition of acrylate monomers. We also investigated the electro-optical performances of PILC devices prepared by using bi-component prepolymers and found that they were related with the surface anchoring effect of polymer walls. Anchoring energy between LC and polymer walls was decreased by introducing fluorinated acrylate monomer into prepolymers and the driving properties of LC molecules by an external electric field were improved. Thus, the control method of polymer wall structure by using bi-component prepolymers can be applied to various types of LC–polymer composite systems for obtaining improved flexible displays.</abstract>

<title>The enhanced navigator for the touch screen: A comparative study on navigational techniques of web maps.</title>

<abstract>Nowadays the web map (E-map) is an indispensable wayfinding tool in the Internet-based society. However, its usability will vary with a different navigational technique or input device. The navigational techniques currently adopted by various web maps were investigated and analyzed. Moreover, two input devices, i.e., the mouse and the touch screen, were operated in four navigational techniques to study the differences in their functions and performances. Later, the research findings were utilized to develop a new navigational technique. The research was divided into two stages. During the first stage, all the navigational techniques in current use were investigated and compared. Then, based on the results of analysis, the enhanced navigator with continuous control (ENCC) was designed. During the second stage, the searching and browsing techniques of different web maps were simulated. Afterwards, the mouse and the touch screen were employed separately to conduct simulation tests in the following navigational techniques: (1) combined panning buttons (CPB), (2) distributed panning buttons (DPB), (3) ENCC, and (4) G&D. A total of 36 participants took part in the trials. At the end of the experiment, the operational performances of the participants were studied through the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); besides, the subjective evaluation questionnaires were answered. It was discovered that the mouse did better than the touch screen in the four navigational techniques. Besides, among the four techniques, ENCC showed the best performance. Capable of continuous control and continuous display, the ENCC interface was upgraded in terms of operational speed and directional control. The findings can be used as a reference in the design of web maps. Also, it is suggested that ENCC should be widely applied to touch screens and mice so that the navigation of information space may be facilitated.</abstract>

<title>Green organic light-emitting diodes with improved stability and efficiency utilizing a wide band gap material as the host.</title>

<abstract>We propose an emitting co-doped system for obtaining high efficient and stable green organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on the host material 9,10-di (2-naphthyl) anthracene (ADN). In these diodes, 2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1,1,7,7,-tetramethyl-1H,5H,11H-10-(2-benzothiazolyl) quinolizino-[9,9a,1gh] coumarin (C545T) and N,N′-dimethyl-quinacridone (DMQA) are co-doped into the ADN emitting layer. In the co-doped emitting layer, ADN act as the exciting energy donor, C545T as the sensitizer and DMQA as green fluorescent dye. The green emission comes from exciton emission in DMQA molecules via a two-step excitation energy transfer from ADN to C545T and then from C545T to DMQA. The co-doped cell 0.6:1.2(wt% C545T: wt% DMQA) has showed the best performance. When the current density was 20 mA/cm2, the brightness of the device exceeded 1400 cd/m2 and maximum luminance reached to 15000 cd/m2 at 12 V with CIEx, y = 0.30, 0.62. The maximum current efficiency of the device reached 10.8 cd/A. Compared with devices where the emitting layer is made of Alq and DMQA, the emission efficiency and stability of the co-doped ADN-based devices are greatly improved. We attribute this significant improvement to effective utilization of the host energy and depression of concentration quenching.</abstract>

<abstract>We studied the degradation and recovery of gallium indium zinc oxide (GIZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) with etch-back (EB) structures during the fabrication process. EB GIZO TFTs were degraded by a source/drain dry etch process that formed a conductive surface layer. Their switching performance was recovered using an O2 ashing process that oxidized the conductive surface layer. In addition, a wet etch of the backside of the GIZO recovered the performance of the GIZO TFTs. EB GIZO TFTs with a field-effect mobility of 14.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a subthreshold swing of 0.1 V/dec were obtained without plasma treatment.</abstract>

<title>How age affects the speed of perception of computer icons.</title>

<abstract>The use of computers is constantly increasing. At the same time the population of the industrialised world is aging. In this study we investigated the speed with which users of different ages can find a specific computer icon from a group of others. Our results show that search performance slows with age when calculated across all three levels of inter-icon spacing (χ2 (4) = 14.904, p < .05) and icon size (χ2 (4) = 15.674, p < .05) used in this study. However, individual variability in search performance was very high within all age groups. Our study suggests that icons used in graphical user interfaces should be at least about 1 degree in size (about 0.7 cm at a viewing distance of 40 cm) for the majority of users to be able to perform their computerised tasks with relative ease. Also, the inter-icon spacing should be moderate, preferably about the same as the icon size. Ideally user interfaces should be adaptable to individual user needs and preferences.</abstract>

<abstract>The paired comparisons method appears to be a promising method in the field of display research. As experimental designs in this field are generally performed using a rather small sample of subjects, general methods described in literature are reconsidered resulting in a specialized analysis for visual perception experiments on displays. This overview describes this modified statistical method which deals with: (1) modelling and testing the significance of z-score differences between the ranked items, (2) testing the effect of an additional factor on z-scores, and (3) corrections of extreme fractions occurring more easily when using small sample sizes.</abstract>

<title>Polyaniline: Application as solid state electrochromic in a flexible textile display.</title>
<pages>1-7</pages>

<volume>34</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>A composite of polyaniline with a flexible nonwoven textile spacer (viscose or PET) has been successfully prepared. Aniline monomer units were initially bound to the surface of the nonwoven substrate and subsequently chemically polymerised in its solid state. The prepared composite was then employed within a flexible four-layer electrochromic device (ECD), previously developed by ourselves. The device consists of the polyaniline–nonwoven composite sandwiched between two electrodes. The lower electrode is silver or carbon black deposited on a flexible PET textile substrate and the upper is flexible and transparent PET/ITO. A reversible colour change of the polyaniline–nonwoven composite is observed, from green to blue, when an electrical voltage (±3 V) is applied to the prepared device. Because polyaniline is used in its solid state it offers an alternative to the liquid state electrochromic previously applied within the developed flexible textile ECD and reduces problems owing to satisfactory sealing and leakage. This paper outlines the preparation and characterisation of the electrochromic polyaniline–nonwoven composite and the electrochromic display prototype in which it is applied. The benefits and drawbacks of the technology are discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>White organic light emitting devices (WOLEDs) with an RBG stacked multilayer structure were demonstrated. In RGB stacked OLEDs, blue emitting, 2-t-butyl-9,10-di-(2-naphthyl)anthracene (TBADN) doped with p-bis(p-N,N-diphenyl-amono-styryl)benzene (DSA-Ph), green emitting, tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum (Alq) doped with C545, and red emitting, tris-[8-hydroxyquinoline]aluminum (Alq) doped with 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-t-butyl-6-(1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidyl-9-enyl)- 4H-pyran (DCJTB), were used. By adjusting the order and thickness of emitting layer in RBG structure, we got a white OLED with current efficiency of 5.60 cd/A and Commission Internationale De L’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.34, 0.34) at 200 mA/cm2. Its maximum luminance was 20,700 cd/m2 at current density of 400 mA/cm2. The results have been explained on the basis of the theory of excitons generation and diffusion. According to the theory of excitons generation and diffusion, an equation has been set up which relates EL spectra to the thickness of every layer and to the exciton diffusion length.</abstract>

<title>Effect of the display medium of a mammogram on microcalcification - diagnostic performance and the subjective preference of radiologists according to differing professional experience.</title>

<abstract>This study was nvestigate the effect of different display media of mammographic images (visual display terminals [VDT] and a view-box) on the display-media diagnostic performance and subjective prefereness of radiologists according to differing professional experience. This study included 30 patients and 120 images (four images per patient) who underwent digital mammography at Changhua Christian Hospital in central Taiwan, using the General Electric digital mammography system. Biopsies indicated that 15 patients had microcalcifications, while the other 15 patients were normal. In this experiment, the interpreting physicians included of five males and one female. The physicians were divided into three groups (attending physicians, radiology residents and interns) according to varying levels of experience and expertise in digital mammography. Three different display media were used, including a medical monitor (BARCO V9601100), a general monitor (SAMSUNG 191T), and an unmasked view-box. A signal-blind test based on these three different display media was used to evaluate the six radiologists' microcalcifications-diagnosis performance and to obtain the area-under-curve (AUC) values from the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves, sensitivity, and specificity. A five-point Likert-type rating scale was used to evaluate the radiologists' subjective preference. The results of the analyses of variances showed that different professional experience settings had a significant effect on all AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. Attending and resident physicians performed significantly better on AUC, sensitivity, and specificity than interns. Different display-type settings had a significant effect on AUC and sensitivity; however, they had no significant effect on specificity. The physicians performed significantly better on AUC when the display types were a BARCO medical LCD and a SAMSUNG general LCD rather than a conventional unmasked view-box. The physicians performed significantly better on sensitivity when the display type was a BARCO medical LCD rather than a SAMSUNG general LCD or a conventional unmasked view-box. Different professional experience provided significantly different preference evaluating (F(2, 16)=6.50, p<0.05), and different display type settings had a significant effect on physicians' diagnosis performance (F(2, 16)=138.5, p<0.05). The results of a Duncan test demonstrated that the physicians' most preferred display media was a BARCO medical LCD. The findings of this research indicate that physicians' better diagnosis performance depends on both their professional experience and a high-resolution medical-level display media to interpret digital mammographic microcalcifications.</abstract>

<title>Effect of ambient illumination level on perceived autostereoscopic display quality and depth perception.</title>

<journal>Displays</journal>

<abstract>Twenty participants viewed real-world videos and still images with a small hand-held autostereoscopic device in three ambient illuminations with three display luminance levels. Perceived depth, naturalness, overall image quality, and viewing discomfort were evaluated. The results show that illumination and luminance levels influence perceived quality parameters, but perceived depth is less sensitive to changes in ambient illumination than other viewing quality parameters associated with 3D viewing. Viewing 3D scenes lasting up to 40 min may cause some mild eyestrain symptoms, but symptoms of visually induced motion sickness are rare. The use of autostereoscopic hand-held devices therefore seems feasible in different contexts with different display luminance levels, and the overall viewing experience is relatively comfortable for most of the adult viewers.</abstract>

<number>2</number>
<abstract>Saccade detection in an eye-movement trace provides a starting point for analyses ranging from the investigation of low-level oculomotor mechanisms to high-level cognitive processes. When the eye tracks the motion of the object of current interest (smooth pursuit), of the visual background (OKN), or of the resultant visual motion from a head movement (tVOR, rVOR), the smooth tracking movement is generally intermixed with rapid-phase saccadic eye movements, which must be excised to analyze the smooth components of tracking behavior properly. We describe a simple method to detect saccades on a background trace of variable velocity, compare our saccade-detection algorithm with the performance of an expert human observer, and present an ideal-observer analysis to benchmark its detection performance.</abstract>

<title>Visual quality evaluation of large LED displays based on subjective sensory perception.</title>

<abstract>Large light-emitting diode (LED) displays have undergone a great deal of development in recent years. One of their main characteristics is their potential for great diversity in their physical parameters (size, brightness, power consumption, etc.) and in the configuration of the LED pixel arrays. The physical parameters can vary by several orders of magnitude, while the matrix can be organized in discrete real RGB pixels or in several types of virtual pixel distributions such as Bayer, Hexagonal and Diagonal. For this reason, it is particularly difficult to make a complete and exhaustive evaluation of any type of displays based only on objective parameters. In this paper we have developed and used a subjective method for evaluating the image quality of various types of LED displays. The results obtained show that there is not a perfect display solution and that for each particular project it is possible to find an optimal LED matrix solution based on quality performance and the number and distribution of LEDs used (that marks pixel resolution, overall manufacturing cost and power consumption). For displays with the same number of LEDs the array of emitters formed by real pixels are desirable for applications viewed at short distances and for predominantly alphanumeric content, while virtual pixels arrays are advantageous in applications requiring greater viewing distances and a higher content of complex images.</abstract>

<title>Visual strategies for the control of steering toward a goal.</title>
<pages>97-104</pages>

<volume>34</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>We have shown that people steer toward a target by aligning their heading with the target when target egocentric direction is not available for steering [24]. Here we examined what visual strategies people use to steer toward a target when target egocentric direction is available for steering. The display simulated a participant walking over a ground plane with a target placed off to one side. The participant’s simulated heading in the display was displaced 10° away from the participant’s straight ahead. A textured ground display that provided dense global optic flow and an empty ground display that provided nearly no flow were tested. Participants were instructed to use a joystick to control their simulated self-motion in the display to (a) steer toward the target, (b) center the target at their straight ahead, or (c) minimize the target drift on the screen. We found that participants produced similar heading error profiles when they were instructed to steer toward the target or to center the target straight ahead, but not when they were instructed to minimize the target movement on the screen. Furthermore, regardless of the instructions received, final heading errors were about 5° smaller with the textured than with the empty ground display, indicating the effect of optic flow on the control performance. We conclude that when target egocentric direction is available for steering, people do not steer toward the target by canceling its optical drift. Optic flow contributes to steering toward a target even when control could be based on egocentric direction alone.</abstract>

<title>Investigation of Curtain Mura in TFT-TN panels after COG ACF process.</title>

<abstract>We have utilized a transmission ratio (TR) between curtain-shaped (Curtain) Mura and non-Mura zones as a key parameter to characterize the optical appearance of Curtain Mura occurred on a 13.3-in TFT–TN panel (Mura sample) after bonding process to place silicon-based driver-IC chips on one of the panel substrates using anisotropic conductive film as a binder (COG ACF process). Our measured TRs of the Mura sample at zero applied voltage were in good agreement with calculated TRs using optical parameters of the Mura sample derived from the measured Stokes parameters of the liquid crystal (LC) medium in that sample. We conclude that the occurrence of Curtain Mura is dominant by the stress-induced change in the twist angle, less sensitive and insensitive to the corresponding induced changes in the cell gap and pretilt angle of the in-panel-LC medium, respectively. By simulation, we also point out a way to reduce the occurrence of Curtain Mura by designing the cell gap for a 90°-twsit TN panel to satisfy the condition of Gooch–Terry first minimum.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper, six organic light emitting devices with different quantum well cycles and different position of well structures have been demonstrated. These well structures were composed by N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(1-napthyl)-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine and tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum, or tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum and 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline. The device with one cycles well structure as electron transporting layer exhibits the highest brightness 3354 cd/m2 and current efficiency of 3.46 cd/A. The current efficiency improved owing to carrier confinement and higher exciton formation probability in the well layer. Results illustrated that using proper period of well structure could improve the current efficiency of organic light emitting device and using well structure as electron transporting layer are better than as hole-transporting layer.</abstract>

<title>Cell parameter extraction method for AC plasma display panels.</title>

<volume>27</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>This paper presents a cell parameter extraction method for three-electrode AC plasma display panels (PDPs). This method uses three different two-electrode AC discharges to extract the cell capacitances. The drive point capacitances of the cell with and without a two-electrode dark discharge were measured, and the cell capacitances were extracted from them. The extracted cell capacitances agree well with those obtained from a three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation. Electrical equivalent circuits of the plasma were constructed using Jung's model [Y.K. Jung, J.W. Seo, Y.H. Kim, B.K. Kang, Circuit model for two-electrode AC discharge, IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci., 31(3), pp. 362–368, 2003.] and the measured firing voltages. A circuit model for the cell was constructed using the cell capacitances and the equivalent circuits for the plasma. The results of electrical simulation using this circuit model agree well with the measurements, indicating that the presented circuit model would be useful for simulating the electrical behaviors of a three-electrode AC PDP.</abstract>

<abstract>White organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) with non-doped structure have been fabricated using an bipolar fluorescent material of 2-{4-[bis(9,9-dimethylfluorenyl)amino]phenyl}-5-(dimesityl boryl)thiophene (FlAMB-1T) as both hole-electron transporting and green light-emitting layer. An ultrathin layer of 3-(dicyanomethylene)-5,5-dimethyl-1-(4-dimethylamino-styryl) cyclohexene (DCDDC) was inserted between two FlAMB-1T layers as a red light-emitting layer and a thin 4,4′-bis(2,2′-diphenyvinyl)-1,1′-dipenyl (DPVBi) as a blue light-emitting layer. The thickness of the FlAMB-1T determined the device spectrum, and enabled a white emission to be achieved. A fairly pure WOLED with Commission Internationale De L’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.33, 0.36) consisting of three primary colors was obtained. The emission mechanisms of DCDDC and the role of FlAMB-1T bipolar material in the WOLED was discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>Thin-film-transistor liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCDs) are the most popular flat panel displays now. Polarizer film is one of the most important components in the TFT-LCDs, which is a multi-layered complex film developed by the technology of stretching film with dichroic materials. In this paper, a systematic review about polarizer film used for TFT-LCDs is given. Structure, property, function and material of each layer and detailed explanations of compensation films as well as its types, especially for the twisted nematic (TN) mode LCD, are summarized. Manufacturing processes of the tri-acetyl cellulose (TAC) film and the polarizer film, attachment process of a polarizer film to a LCD panel and the key technologies in these processes are illustrated. Examples in practical applications and technology development trends in the future are also presented.</abstract>

<number>3</number>
<abstract>VITAL is an acronym for VIbro-TActiLe display concepts and devices. The new tactile displays presented are based on an integrated electromagnetic actuator arranged in a (8 × 8) pin matrix. A multilayer approach with a simple assembly procedure enables the development of a new generation of competitively priced tactile matrices with potentially high micro-actuator density. The independent amplitude and frequency control of each pin facilitates displaying various haptic patterns; hence, the displays can be used as haptic communication media. VITAL aims to satisfy both market and haptic research requirements. This paper uses a haptic communication scenario to detail the research and technological development of the first prototype (VITAL1) and its validating experiment results. Extensions of the VITAL display technology through two additional variants and other applications’ perspectives are also discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>Graphene is a highly promising candidate to replace oxide-based conducting materials for fabrication of transparent electrodes used in flexible displays and electronic devices. However, so far an appropriate method is still not found to provide high-quality, low-cost graphene in a large quantity. To overcome this issue, we demonstrate that massive graphene sheets can be synthesized by electrochemical exfoliation process using artificial graphite as a starting material. The product is mainly composed of bilayer thin graphene sheets. Their lateral size can be up to several to 20 μm, and the quality determined by Raman spectroscopy is better than the reduced graphene oxide derived from graphene oxide. The transparent conducting films made of electrochemically exfoliated graphene can be simply prepared by an airbrush spraying method, which is easy to scale up for large-area deposition, and compatible with flexible polymer substrates.</abstract>

<abstract>This study was conducted by subjective and objective measurement, to clarify the complex relationships among human visual preference and fatigue of major Flat Panel Display TVs with related physical and physiological factors. In the subjective measurement, comparison tests with 24 subjects were conducted and the semantic differential method with factor analysis was carried out for six TVs with different room luminance and length of watching time. The comparison test yielded identification of the most preferable display, which showed little connection with the TV luminance for any length of watching time and room luminance. From the statistical factor analysis of semantic differential method, significant factors were extracted for describing human visual preference. In the objective measurement, the eye motion tracking camera was used to detect the eye response and thus generated physiological data corroborated the significant factors extracted from the subjective measurement. This study allows the human perceptual preference and fatigue of electronic displays to be quantitatively measured with psychological and physiological factors and will tell which parameters are significant and guide the manufacturer in making the optimum TVs.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper uses patent network analysis to investigate technological trends in the field of flexible display fabrication through technology centrality index (TCI) and technology cycle time (TCT) index. The fabrication of electrophoretic display (EPD) was indicated as the key factor in future development of flexible display. Further, the critical technologies were obtained from cluster analysis, and the density index (DI) value of each cluster identified the invention of key materials for electro-optic display as the most important subject, especially in flexible EPD. Finally, recent journal publications and website reports using display key materials as electrophoretic ink could prove that development of EPD device was most important and close to marketing trend. The procedure of this patent network analysis presents significant insights quickly in the field of flexible display fabrication. This fruitful methodology is capable of supporting technological trends effectively for the researchers who are interested in scientific field.</abstract>

<abstract>Eighty-seven participants read an e-book either from a near-to-eye display, a small-size display or a hard copy. Eyestrain, visually induced motion sickness, changes in visual functioning, user experience, and the essential optical parameters of the reading equipment were evaluated. The results indicate that reading from a hard copy was the most comfortable experience. All near-to-eye displays induced eyestrain and sickness symptoms, but the magnitude of these symptoms varied according to the device. The adverse symptoms were related to problems with the display optics and design, text layout, headset fit, use context, and individual differences.</abstract>

<title>Enhanced properties of organic electroluminescent devices with cesium chloride ultra-thin layer.</title>
<pages>69-74</pages>
<year>2013</year>
<volume>34</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>The effect of various positions and thicknesses of cesium chloride (CsCl) layer in organic light-emitting diodes is investigated. The basic device configuration is indium–tin–oxide (ITO)/N,N′-bis-(1-naphthl)-diphenyl-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (NPB)/tris (8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3)/aluminum (Al). The following results are demonstrated. When the CsCl layer is placed at the Alq3/Al interface and closer to the Al cathode inside Alq3 layer, the effective barrier to electron injection is reduced due to the reaction between Cs and Al. As a result, the injection of electrons and holes is more balanced and the efficiency is enhanced from 1.83 to 3.49 cd/A. And as an electron injection layer, CsCl can be comparable with lithium fluoride (LiF). If the distance of the CsCl layer is more than 20 nm from Alq3/Al interface inside Alq3 layer, the luminance and efficiency are enhanced but the injection is not increased, which is attributed to trap sites induced by the CsCl layer. The decrease of luminance and efficiency is observed when the CsCl layer is located at the NPB/Alq3 interface. The reason is exciton quenching due to charge transfer from metal Cs to organic material Alq3. The CsCl layer inside NPB layer plays a role of hole blocking. More balanced injection of carriers is expected. Subsequently, both luminance and efficiency are enhanced by 34% and 60%, respectively. When the cathode of lithium fluoride (LiF)/Al is used, the device efficiency is also improved from 4.0 to 5.0 cd/A by inserting the CsCl layer inside NPB layer. However, the improvement is not observed for the device with the CsCl layer inserted inside Alq3 layer in LiF/Al-OLED.</abstract>

<abstract>The technique is suggested for a kind of pulse-width-modulation LED dimming in LED video displays. The significant increase of the gray levels number and image refresh frequency can be achieved when the large number of LEDs is controlled serially. The need for a large number of grayscale levels and high refresh rate is explained. The controlling data flow and the amount of buffer memory are the same as with binary-weighted pulse-width-modulation. Spreading the switching pulses in time reduces the electromagnetic interference.</abstract>

<volume>32</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>4</number>
<abstract>The most cited theory on motion sickness is the conflict theory by Reason and Brand (1975) [1], stating that motion sickness occurs due to a conflict between the senses and stored patterns of motion. In addition, there seems to be evidence for another theory stating that postural instability is a necessary and sufficient condition preceding motion sickness (Riccio and Stoffregen, 1991 [2]). A number of additional observations reviewed in this paper, however, are nuancing the relationship at issue, thus devaluating the latter theory. Moreover, a central mechanism as assumed before (Bos and Bles, 2002 [20]), driving both our posture and motion sickness symptoms, may explain why and when postural instability is correlated with sickness, and when it is not.</abstract>

<title>Quantitative evaluation of effects of visually-induced motion sickness based on causal coherence functions between blood pressure and heart rate.</title>

<volume>29</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>Recent advances in video and computer graphics technologies have been accelerating creation of novel visual images including complex and intensive motion of the visual point. However, there are concerns about adverse effects of these images on humans such as visually-induced motion sickness (VIMS). To evaluate the effects of VIMS, the present study has analyzed the linearity of the baroreflex system and that of the mechanical hemodynamic system by using causal coherence functions. The causal coherence functions have a capability of calculating linear correlation between two systems independently even if the systems are connected with each other to compose a closed-loop system. In the experiment, healthy human subjects’ heart rate and continuous blood pressure were measured to obtain the causal coherence functions when the subjects were watching an unstable video image. The results showed that there were significant differences in the causal coherence functions as well as the traditional coherence function between the sick and the well groups and that the hemodynamic system was mainly disturbed by VIMS rather than the baroreflex system. These findings suggest that the causal coherence functions of the two systems and the traditional coherence function of the whole system gave different information from one another. This fact implies that the causal coherence functions will be useful and objective means to quantify VIMS as functions of time.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper, we report the experimental findings for improving the luminance and luminance efficacy in an AC plasma display panel using a new sustain waveform. The original waveform consists of bipolar sustain pulses of equal amplitudes and widths on both the sustain and scan electrodes. The proposed waveform modifies the pulse width and amplitude of the conventional bipolar voltage pulses. On reducing the pulse width of one of the applied sustains pulse; we observe the increase in luminance by 17% and luminance efficacy by 36% which is independent of the pulse polarity. The application of negative wider pulse (2.1 μs) of high amplitude (180 V) and positive shorter pulse (0.5 μs) of low amplitude (30 V) yields additive enhancement of the luminance by 26% and luminance efficacy by 19%. This new sustain waveform can be used to develop new generation high efficacy plasma displays.</abstract>

<abstract>About 30% of the population has difficulties detecting the sign and the magnitude of binocular disparity in the absence of eye movements, a phenomenon called stereo-anomaly. The stereo-anomaly tests so far are based on disparity only (e.g. red–green stereograms), which means that other depth cues cannot be used and even provide conflicting depth information.</abstract>

<abstract>A new Mn activated Ba co-doped ZnS phosphor shows an interesting shift in the spectral emission from amber-yellow (570 nm) to red (620 nm) colour. To realize the phosphor material physics, attempts were made to fine tune the band gap of ZnS by co-doping Ba within the concentration range 2.50–10 mol%. Ba co-doping in ZnS host was achieved by sintering BaSO4 with ZnS at 900 °C by carbothermal reduction method. Measurement of the CIE (Commission International deEchairge) chromaticity colour coordinates (x, y) of Zn0.99S:Mn0.01 and Ba0.10Zn0.89S:Mn0.01 phosphors shown to be (0.53, 0.47) and (0.65, 0.32), respectively.</abstract>

<abstract>With the development of three-dimensional television (3DTV), the fatigue associated with watching 3DTV has received considerable attention. To study how watching 3DTV influences mental fatigue and to investigate the related objective indicators, we use physiological detectors to record EEGs of 10 individual subjects both before and after watching 2D or 3D television. The 2D/3D changes of both energy values of EEG in the four wavebands, namely alpha (α), beta (β), theta (θ), delta (δ), and four fatigue-related algorithms (α + θ)/β, α/β, (α + θ)/(α + β) and θ/β, were compared and analyzed. The results show that the parameters for the 3DTV group, except theta rhythm, changed more significantly than those for the 2DTV groups in some brain regions. For most subjects watching 3DTV, the energy in alpha and beta frequency bands significantly decrease while delta activity shows a significant increase, and theta activity remains largely unchanged. All four algorithms show a significant increase with algorithm (α + θ)/β showing a greater increase (p < 0.01) on individual electrodes. The results of this study have implications for detecting fatigue associated with watching 3DTV. The above parameters, combined with subjective evaluations, can serve as objective indicators to evaluate the level of 3DTV fatigue.</abstract>

<abstract>This research attempts to find the observation threshold of product representation angles recognized by the general public. It also approaches the possible factors affecting the observation threshold of product representation angles – “familiarity” and “product component” to study the related factors. This research uses NOKIA 8250 as the objective cellular phone, and the contrasting cellular phone of component difference found in the previous test. It uses questionnaires to divide subjects, according to familiarity, into groups for experiments, and then calculate the representation angle observation threshold of subjects. The conclusions of this research are: (1) The observation thresholds of product representation angles are found as an X shape on the distribution maps, and the two sides of the distribution maps show the difficult recognition areas. (2) Familiarity affects the observation threshold of cellular phone representation angles, while product component difference show little effect. (3) Most subjects favor a clockwise or up turned presentation angle of cellular phone. (4) Products with sufficient components show a larger range of representation angle observation threshold.</abstract>

<abstract>This study investigated the effects of the type of menu (WinCE and Palm) and the stage of usage (whether the current usage is the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or eighth day of usage) on the users' performance in operating a menu displayed in the first, second, or third layers of a PDA display. The findings of this study indicated that the subjects performed significantly differently in response to Palm and WinCE menus displayed in the first and second layers. The Palm menu resulted in better operating performance. However, the Palm and WinCE menus displayed in the third layer did not result in significantly different operating performance. In addition, the amount of previous use significantly affected users' operating performance only with menus displayed in all the layers. The operating performance improved as the usage time increased. Regarding the subjects' subjective preferences, using the Palm-menu design was initially favored more than the WinCE-menu; however, their preferences for using both menus increased with the usage time.</abstract>

<title>Perceptual attributes of crosstalk in 3D images.</title>

<abstract>Nowadays, crosstalk is probably one of the most annoying distortions in 3D displays. So far, display designers still have a relative lack of knowledge about the relevant subjective attributes of crosstalk and how they are combined in an overall 3D viewing experience model. The aim of the current experiment is to investigate three perceptually important attributes influencing the overall viewing experience: perceived image distortion, perceived depth, and visual strain. The stimulus material used in this experiment consisted of two natural scenes varying in depth (0, 4, and 12 cm camera base distance) and crosstalk level (0, 5, 10, and 15%). Subjects rated the attributes according to the ITU BT.500–10 in a controlled experiment. Results show that image distortion ratings show a clear increase with increasing crosstalk and increasing camera base distance. Especially higher crosstalk levels are more visible at larger camera base distances. Ratings of visual strain and perceived depth only increase with increasing camera base distance and remain constant with increasing crosstalk (at least until 15% crosstalk).</abstract>

<abstract>Technological innovations over the last decade resulted in significant improvements in the LCD’s viewing angle performance. Consequently, the current method to define the viewing cone, with a fixed contrast ratio, does not represent perceived performance differences between displays. Our previous study, with two LCDs and a plasma display, revealed that changes in image quality with viewing angle are predicted by combining luminance variations and white-point shifts for an intermediate grey level. In this paper, we show that, for viewers comparing the viewing angle dependent quality between displays, that same relation holds. If the calculated viewing angle is larger than the measured acceptability threshold, the remaining quality at the threshold angle serves as a viewing angle performance indicator.</abstract>

<abstract>Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) hold a large share of the flat-panel display market because LCDs offer advantages such as low power consumption, low radiation, and good image quality. However, image defects, such as spotlight, uniformity, and Mura defects, can impair the quality of an LCD. This research examined human perceptions of region-Mura and used Response Time and subjective markdown price to indicate the various severity levels of region-Mura that appeared at different display locations.</abstract>

<abstract>Sphere-shaped green phosphor, Zn2SiO4:Mn, with 100–500 nm of average diameter was successfully prepared by the reverse emulsion method to formulate the phosphor ink for ink-jet processing. It was found that the aqueous phosphor ink exhibited excellent dispersion stability by introducing organic low molecular weight additives such as nonionic type of fatty acid containing ethylene oxide (BYK 192®), 3-(2-aminoethyl)aminopropyl trimethoxy silane (SA0700®) and acetic acid, due to the combination of the steric hindrance originated from BYK 192® and charge repulsion from SA0700® and acetic acid. The patterned phosphor layers with thickness uniformity (±0.008 μm to ± 0.055 μm depending on the formulation of phosphor inks) and precisely controlled thickness (in the range of 5–50 μm) in between barrier ribs could be obtained by using ink-jet printing with optimized process parameters such as nozzle diameter, dispensing pressure and nozzle moving speed. Optical properties of the resulting phosphor layers fired at different temperatures were compared in terms of PL emission intensity and color coordinate.</abstract>

<abstract>Cybersickness embraces a range of clinical symptoms reported in response to simulated motion in a computer generated, virtual reality environment. The Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) has been the standard tool for measuring observed responses; however, many of the observed SSQ variables are highly correlated, so it is not clear which ones are appropriate to use as a basis for building an explanatory model. In this study, responses to the SSQ were analyzed using principal components analysis, and four significant factors – general cybersickness, vision, arousal and fatigue – were identified. An initial interpretation of these factors is provided in the context of a broader cybersickness model, with a view to constructing a new questionnaire with fewer, more focused questions.</abstract>

<title>Visual gamma correction for LCD displays.</title>
<pages>17-23</pages>
<year>2011</year>
<volume>32</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>An improved method for visual gamma correction is developed for LCD displays to increase the accuracy of digital colour reproduction. Rather than utilising a photometric measurement device, we use observers’ visual luminance judgements for gamma correction. Eight half tone patterns were designed to generate relative luminances from 1/9 to 8/9 for each colour channel. A psychophysical experiment was conducted on an LCD display to find the digital signals corresponding to each relative luminance by visually matching the half-tone background to a uniform colour patch. Both inter- and intra-observer variability for the eight luminance matches in each channel were assessed and the luminance matches proved to be consistent across observers (ΔE00 < 3.5) and repeatable (ΔE00 < 2.2). Based on the individual observer judgements, the display opto-electronic transfer function (OETF) was estimated by using either a 3rd order polynomial regression or linear interpolation for each colour channel. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by predicting the CIE tristimulus values of a set of coloured patches (using the observer-based OETFs) and comparing them to the expected CIE tristimulus values (using the OETF obtained from spectro-radiometric luminance measurements). The resulting colour differences range from 2 to 4.6 ΔE00. We conclude that this observer-based method of visual gamma correction is useful to estimate the OETF for LCD displays. Its major advantage is that no particular functional relationship between digital inputs and luminance outputs has to be assumed.</abstract>

<abstract>The Taguchi method has been successfully applied in engineering fields to deal with a single performance quality problem, but it is not often used in interface design and the handling of multiple performance quality problems. This study investigated a multi-response problem in terms of searching time, number of missing characters/buttons (NMCB), and visual fatigue by integrating the Taguchi method and the weighting method to optimize the Chinese interface design parameters such as display type, character size, font type, and text/background color combination in motion environments. The results indicated that subjects’ visual performance was improved when using the optimum interface setting (LCD, 7.5 ∗ 7.5 mm, Kai font and white/blue color combination) rather than the current interface setting.</abstract>

<title>Effect of the field of view on perceiving world-referenced image motion during concurrent head movements.</title>
<pages>165-170</pages>
<year>2013</year>
<volume>34</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>We have previously shown that concurrent head movements impair head-referenced image motion perception when compensatory eye movements are suppressed (Li, Adelstein, & Ellis, 2009) [16]. In this paper, we examined the effect of the field of view on perceiving world-referenced image motion during concurrent head movements. Participants rated the motion magnitude of a horizontally oscillating checkerboard image presented on a large screen while making yaw or pitch head movements, or holding their heads still. As the image motion was world-referenced, head motion elicited compensatory eye movements from the vestibular-ocular reflex to maintain the gaze on the display. The checkerboard image had either a large (73°H × 73°V) or a small (25°H × 25°V) field of view (FOV). We found that perceptual sensitivity to world-referenced image motion was reduced by 20% during yaw and pitch head movements compared to the veridical levels when the head was still, and this reduction did not depend on the display FOV size. Reducing the display FOV from 73°H × 73°V to 25°H × 25°V caused an overall underestimation of image motion by 7% across the head movement and head still conditions. We conclude that observers have reduced perceptual sensitivity to world-referenced image motion during concurrent head movements independent of the FOV size. The findings are applicable in the design of virtual environment countermeasures to mitigate perception of spurious motion arising from head tracking system latency.</abstract>

<abstract>A questionnaire was developed to subjectively assess visual fatigue caused by viewing various types of motion images. The questionnaire was evaluated using four types of moving images; playing a TV game using an HMD or a TV, viewing images with and without stabilization of camera shake, viewing a movie with and without colour break-up and viewing either a stereoscopic movie (anaglyph method) or a nonstereoscopic movie. Factor analysis revealed five factors: (1) Eye Strain, (2) General Discomfort, (3) Nausea, (4) Focusing Difficulty and (5) Headache, which were effective for classifying motion images.</abstract>

<title>Effect of sputtering condition on the surface properties of silicon oxide thin films prepared for liquid crystal alignment layers.</title>

<abstract>SiOx thin films are widely used for the LC alignment layer for LCoS devices due to the thermal and photochemical stability of SiOx. In this work, the relationship between the sputtering condition and the LC alignment properties of SiOx thin films was studied. The physical and chemical properties of SiOx thin films were closely related with the RF power and the working pressure of RF-magnetron sputtering. The surface energy of SiOx thin films was mainly connected with the chemical composition of the SiOx thin films and the behavior of LC molecules on the SiOx thin films was dominantly affected by the surface energy. The azimuthal anchoring energy and the pretilt angle of LC molecules were changed by modifying the amount of oxygen atom in the SiOx thin films. By controlling the sputtering condition of SiOx thin films, it was possible to control the orientation of LC molecules on the SiOx thin films.</abstract>

<abstract>A multilayer organic light-emitting diode (OLED) has been fabricated with a thin (1 nm) potassium chloride (KCl) layer inserted inside an electron transport layer (ETL), tris (8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3). The structure of device was ITO/NPB/Alq3/KCl/Alq3/Al. The KCl layer was inserted inside 60 nm Alq3 at 10, 20 and 30 nm positions away from the Alq3/Al interface. The device shows the optical power and electroluminescence (EL) efficiency enhancements. The highest optical power density of devices with KCl at different positions is more than twice as high as that of the device without KCl. The EL efficiency is enhanced by more than 50% by inserting the thin KCl insulating layer. The mechanism of KCl EL efficiency enhancer is that the thin KCl layer induces carrier trap sites and gives better recombination in the device. After air-exposure 42 h, the efficiency of the devices with KCl is enhanced but not for the device without KCl. The insertion of KCl inside Alq3 may improve the stability of OLED.</abstract>

<abstract>AMOLEDs (active-matrix organic light emitting diodes) employing poly-Si TFT have been used to integrate peripheral circuits on a glass to reduce the cost through the use of dead space on the glass. The system-on-glass (SOG) development provides enormous challenges to the developers, usually verifying the SOG by transistor-level simulation. IR-drop modeling is needed to reduce the uniformity degradation in the OLED image quality. This paper presents a full panel simulation technique for OLED driver and pixels that is integrated on a glass using the mixed-signals circuit design and the proposed process shows excellent capabilities relating to the capacity and the speed.</abstract>

<title>A distortion-free data hiding scheme for high dynamic range images.</title>
<pages>225-236</pages>
<year>2011</year>
<volume>32</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>5</number>
<abstract>In this paper we present a distortion-free data hiding algorithm which can embed secret messages into high dynamic range (HDR) images. Our scheme provides three significant benefits. First, it enables us to convey secret messages to produce a stego HDR image. When we operate the tone mapping technique to reduce the high contrast to a displayable range, no distortion is encountered between the tone-mapped cover and the stego images. A quantitative measure verifies that histograms of the cover and stego HDR images are correlated with linear dependency. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first approach in HDR literature that can provide capability of distortion-free data embedding. For the application of image annotation, the average capacity offered by our method is in the range of 0.12–0.29 bits per pixel. Our scheme provides an average capacity in the range of 0.0010–0.0026 bits per pixel for the application of image steganography where the stego HDR image preserves an HDR image encoding format which does not cause any suspicion by eavesdroppers. Second, our algorithm performs with adaptive message embedding where pixels conceal different amounts of secret messages based on their homogeneous representations. Quantitative analysis indicates that our algorithm offers an insignificantly small magnitude of the maximal pixel difference between the cover and stego HDR images. This feature and the histogram distribution of similarity between the cover and stego HDR images increase the difficulty of detecting whether any message is hidden in an HDR image. Third, our scheme is efficient. The time required for message embedding or extraction is in the range of several hundred milliseconds. Our approach belongs to a blind detection where the messages can be extracted without referring to the original cover HDR image. We believe our proposed scheme is suitable for applications such as image annotation or image steganography.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents a dot generation scheme based on molecular dynamics (MD) method applied to the illumination design of a round plane source lighting the round shape of an LCD display constituted by the light emitting diodes (LEDs) and the light guide. This scheme accommodates the needs of the dot generation on the base of the round light guide and offers flexibility in the adjustment of dot distribution, which can been easily integrated with the optical design phase to reach the uniformity condition for a plane source. The scheme employed a fixed boundary technique, incorporated with the tangential elliptical force field to provide the best enclosure ability—this allows the dots to be kept within the boundary points during the force regulation. A validation of present scheme is presented, and finally, an example of the integration of the present scheme and optical design of the round light guide is presented and discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>In this work, characteristics of top-emitting organic light-emitting devices (TEOLEDs) having Ag and Au as anode had been investigated. When using the same emitting materials, the performance of TEOLEDs employing Ag as anode was superior to that of the device using Au as anode. Finally, by using the appropriate dopant instead of Alq as emitter, a TEOLED with high power efficiency (8.7 lm/w with luminance of 640 cd/m2), almost independent on viewing angle had been reported.</abstract>

<abstract>In order to provide suitable design guidelines for TV programme designers setting Chinese horizontal/vertical leading displays, two stages are involved in this study. The purpose of the first stage was to investigate the current situation of using horizontal/vertical leading displays on LCD TVs news channels. The purpose of the second stage was to examine the effects of horizontal/vertical leading display, speed, and display field lengths on reading comprehension of LCD TVs. A three-way between factorial designed experiment (4 × 3 × 2) was designed to examine the effects of leading-display positions (top, bottom, left, and right sides), display speeds (85 cpm, 205 cpm, and 325 cpm), and display field lengths (7 and 24 characters). Scores for reading comprehension revealed that the main display position was set on the left and bottom-sides. The Hei font was the highest frequency for using on horizontal leading displays and the Yuan font for using on vertical leading displays. The Chinese characters of leading display showed negative polarity on the TV news channels (light-coloured characters on a dark background). The design guidelines of Chinese leading display on LCD TVs were: (1) display speed should be set under 205 cpm, (2) the appropriate message length recommends setting at least 10 characters, and (3) the deal position recommends arranging on the bottom or top of the screen and avoiding on the right side.</abstract>

The qualitative analysis of the complexes to detect the presence of rare earth (Eu, Tb), have been performed by energy dispersive analysis (EDX). The Eu(HMAP)3·2H2O on excitation at 354 nm emits bright red luminescence with main peak at 612 nm and Tb(HMAP)3·2H2O on excitation at 354 nm emits bright green luminescence with main peak at 547 nm. The luminescence intensity of Eu(HMAP)3·2H2O is higher than Tb(HMAP)3·2H2O. These complexes emitting red and green luminescence might be used to make the electroluminescent (EL) devices for display applications.</abstract>

<abstract>The approximation functions of the directivity of the light emitting diodes (LED) have been investigated. LEDs used in large scale LED video displays have been studied. LED directional properties among the other parameters define the video display image quality. The simplicity of an approximation function and ease of analytical handling have been targeted. These functions suppose to be used in display directivity engineering. Four candidate approximation functions were identified and their approximation performance analyzed. The evaluation is done on eight different type LEDs’ sample batches. These samples have been chosen to represent the variety of the main colors and the range of the most popular viewing angles used in large scale LED video displays design. The relative intensity approximation root mean square (RMS) error and approximation errors’ cross correlation have been used as performance estimation criteria. The radiometric intensity variation within a manufacturing lot was suggested as lower error bound. Approximation error variance was analyzed for various approximation ranges. Results of four candidate approximation functions’ performance on eight different type LEDs’ are presented.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper proposes a new color image authentication scheme, aiming at tamper detection and recovery, based on error correction coding and Bayer Pattern. The bit stream generated by coding an image block with BCH (15, 7) is treated as the authentication information while the Bayer Pattern technique is adopted to achieve tamper remedy. The service of tamper remedy is valuable in saving the bandwidth of image re-transmitting, seldom addressed in existing image authentication schemes. The experimental results show the performance in sensitive integrity detection, accurate localization and imperceptible remedy. Security of image authentication techniques is achieved only when the false positive/negative probability is taken into consideration as well as guaranteeing detection, localization and remedy. In the end, the security of the present scheme is analyzed.</abstract>

<abstract>The objective of this study is to present a new flexible-characteristic inspection system (FCIS) for measuring bending characteristics of flexible substrates under different bending conditions. In order to quantize bending conditions, charge-coupled device image feedback control is utilized to control radii of curvature of the flexible substrates. As a result, the new technique successfully measures electrical characteristics of flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/indium tin oxide substrates up to 11,000 bending times by using FCIS. In addition, optical-transmittance characteristic measurement of PET/hexamethyldisiloxane substrates up to 5000 bending times under the same radius of curvature is implemented by using FCIS in this study. Inspection results of bending characteristics depicted on flexible displays help a designer or maker of flexible displays design useful and comfortable flexible electronic products.</abstract>

<abstract>A white-light-emitting device has been fabricated with a structure of ITO/NPB/BCP/Alq3/LiF/Al. The hole blocking layer(BCP) result in a mixture of lights from NPB molecules (blue-light) and Alq3 molecules (olivine-light), thereby producing white-light emission. The chromaticity can be readily adjusted by only varying the thickness of the BCP layer. The CIE coordinates of the device are largely insensitive to the driving voltages. The maximum brightness is 5740 cd/m2, the EL efficiency is 2.12 cd/A at the applied voltage of 18 V.</abstract>

<title>Influence of wall charge distribution on time lag of address discharge in AC plasma display panels.</title>
<pages>195-201</pages>
<year>2008</year>
<volume>29</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>The influence of wall charge distribution on the time lag of address discharge in an AC plasma display panel is investigated using two different reset waveforms: one (typical reset) induces both face and surface discharges and the other (TR reset) induces face discharges only. The measured formative time lag and statistical time lag of address discharge for TR were 21–31 ns and 31–74 ns shorter than the one for the typical reset, respectively. The TR reset resulted in much less increase of statistical time lag than the typical reset when the reset-to-address time interval was increased, and ∼70 ns smaller deviation of the statistical time lag among different color cells. Calculations show that the TR reset forms a much smoother wall charge profile, which is less susceptible to cell parameter variations, than the typical reset. The observed differences in the time lags of address discharge between different scan lines and color cells are strongly correlated to the differences of the wall charge profile, indicating that a smooth wall charge profile formed by the reset using face discharges only reduces the time lag of address discharge and minimizes the susceptibility of address discharge to cell parameter variation.</abstract>

<title>Biased scan of plasma display panel for data voltage reduction.</title>
<pages>21-27</pages>
<year>2012</year>
<volume>33</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>This paper proposes a method of reducing the data voltage Vd of plasma display panels (PDPs). The proposed biased-scan method uses two separate ground systems: one for the sustain pulse generator (FGND) and the other for the data address and control systems (CHGND). A dc voltage bias, which is applied between CHGND and FGND during the address period, reduces Vd while preventing the undesired glow discharge induced by a scan pulse only. CHGND is connected to FGND for the first sustain pulse of each subfield, which reduces the time lag of address discharge, but it is separated from FGND for the other sustain pulses to increase the margin of the sustain voltage. The proposed method was tested on a 15% Xe 50-in. Full HD (1920 × 1080) single-scan PDP which had a sustain discharge gap of 110 μm. Vd could be reduced by 20 V (30%), and the power consumption of the Vd voltage source decreased by ∼25 W (50%) from that of the conventional method.</abstract>

<title>Performances enhancement in OLEDs by inserting ultrathin trilayer in electron injection structure and using MoO<sub>3</sub> as hole buffer layer.</title>

<volume>32</volume>

<abstract>In order to improve performance of Organic Light-emitting Diodes (OLEDs) in this paper, the electron injection is enhanced by inserting an ultrathin Alq3–LiF–Al trilayer in between the organic layer and the LiF/Al cathode, which is explained by the formation of a thin n-doped Alq3 layer that improves electron injection. At the same time, a buffer layer using MoO3 was induced between m-MTDATA and N,N′-bis-[1-naphthy(-N,N′diphenyl-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine)](NPB) to prompt hole injection because not only the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of MoO3 is suitable to be used as buffer layer but also the interfacial doping effect of MoO3 induces interfacial charge transfer complex formation between MoO3 and NPB. At current density of 20 mA/cm2, compared with control device, the current efficiency, power efficiency and luminance of device using ultrathin Alq3–LiF–Al trilayer and MoO3 were increased by 64%, 101% and 63% respectively, while driving voltage was reduced by 26%. After a series of single-carrier devices were made to analyze performance improvement of device using ultrathin Alq3–LiF–Al trilayer and MoO3, it is found that efficient carrier balance can improve device performance remarkably.</abstract>

<abstract>Molecular organic light-emitting devices (MOLED) and polymer devices (POLED) were fabricated using a novel iridium complex bis[2-(4′-tert-butylphenyl)-1-phenyl-1H-benzoimidazole-N,C2′] iridium (III) (acetylacetonate) phosphor as an emissive dye doped in two different host materials. Electroluminescent (EL) property, current density–voltage–luminance, and current efficiency characteristics of two kinds of devices were measured. The results showed that MOLED has a maximum current efficiency of 22.9 cd/A at a luminance of 163 cd/m2, which is higher than that of 7.6 cd/A at 371 cd/m2 for POLED. MOLED and POLED exhibited a maximum luminance of 13,500 and 4181 cd/m2, respectively, with a full width at half-maximum of MOLED spectra is 68 nm, which is much narrower than 116 nm of POLED spectra.</abstract>

<title>Autostereoscopic multi-view 3D display with pivot function, using the image display of the square subpixel structure.</title>

<abstract>We designed an autostereoscopic multi-view 3D display that has pivot function. Slanted parallax barrier and the image display with subpixel structure of the square shape is used. Subpixels corresponding to each viewing zone show the tendency of the uniform distribution for odd view number in case of the optical elements of the slanted angle of arctan(1/2) or (1/3). Due to the square subpixel shape, large change of zone distance can be prevented under 90 rotation of the display. By optimizing the slanted angle of the optical element and the zone distances, conditions were found where 3D subpixels are uniformly distributed and zone distance is smaller than the interocular distance at the portrait mode as well as at the landscape mode. 3D prototype was fabricated using LCD of 15-in. diagonal size and luminance distribution for each viewing zone was measured under 90-degree rotation. 3D performance under 90-degree rotation was verified by displaying 3D images of the different amount of the disparity.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper, an equivalent circuit model for discharge cells of alternating current plasma display panel (AC PDP) is developed. In this model, a voltage controlled switch is introduced to describe the breakdown process of the gas discharge. And two zener diodes are introduced to describe the sustain process of the gas discharge. Three internal discharge characteristic parameters, the breakdown voltage of discharge gap, the minimum sustain voltage of discharge gap and the discharge cell capacitance ratio, are proposed. The formulas for expressing external discharge characteristic parameters by internal discharge characteristic parameters are derived. The experimental method for measuring internal characteristic parameters is developed and the measurement results for a macro discharge cell are presented.</abstract>

<title>Influence of wall charge on image sticking phenomena in AC plasma display panels.</title>

<volume>30</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>This paper investigates the image sticking phenomenon in an AC plasma display panel (PDP), which appears when the PDP is subjected to a strong sustain discharge for an extended time and leaves a residual image on the display. This problem is very difficult to resolve using a conventional reset. Image sticking was investigated by observing the light emission from the reset, indicating that the wall charges accumulated on the sustain electrodes were the major cause. A few face (plate-gap) discharges equated the wall voltages on the sustain electrodes and set all cells of the PDP at the same external voltage for firing a surface discharge. The image sticking phenomenon disappeared after the face discharges.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents a waveform for driving a high-resolution plasma display panel (PDP) which uses a gas mixture of high Xe content. To prevent degradation of picture quality due to unstable discharges between two facing electrodes, the common electrode was biased at a negative voltage during the set-up period, and the data electrode was biased at a positive voltage during the sustain period. A pre-reset pulse was used before the first reset to reduce the reset voltage and to form a proper wall charge state for sustain discharges. This waveform could drive a 15% Xe 42 in. XGA (1024 × 768) PDP with the single-scan method. The measured black luminescence, peak luminescence, and contrast ratio were 0.45, 1490 cd/m2, and 3310:1, respectively. The measured margin of the sustain voltage was better than ±10 V.</abstract>

<abstract>Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) devices are widely available in both horizontal and vertical formats. This study investigates user preferences for the PDA format and defines an optimal screen layout for each format in terms of the relative positioning of the image and the vocabulary item. The experimental results indicate that there is no significant difference in the user preference for the PDA format. In the vertical format PDA, it is found that the vocabulary term should ideally be positioned below the image. Meanwhile, in the horizontal format PDA, the vocabulary item should be positioned to the right of the image.</abstract>

<abstract>We proposed a method to fabricate large area uniform microlens array with a wide range of focal length for integral imaging. A thin hydrophilic layer with matrix array of circular holes was first fabricated on flat substrate by photolithography. A hydrophobic layer was then imprinted on top of the hydrophilic layer. By filling a very low viscosity prepolymer material into each circular hole via drop-on-demand printing, refractive lens with spherical shape was self assembled by force of surface tension. An integral imaging system using the proposed microlens array was demonstrated by closely placing object to the microlens array. The good image quality indicates that the proposed polymer microlens array has potential applications in three-dimensional displays.</abstract>

<abstract>In this letter, we have fabricated an efficient, color stable white organic electroluminescent device through the incorporation of double thin 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-t-butyl-6(1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidyl-9-enyl)-4H-pyran (DCJTB) emitting layers and 4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (NPB), a hole transporting and blue emitting material. The device structure is ITO/NPB 45 nm/DCJTB 0.15 nm/NPB 5 nm/DCJTB 0.15 nm/BCP 10 nm/AlQ 50 nm/LiF 0.3 nm/Al 150 nm. This device exhibited a pure white-light emission having Commission Internationale de I’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.324, 0.336), a current efficiency of 2.9 cd/A and a maximum brightness of 7016 cd/m2. When the current density increased from 2 mA/cm2 to 100 mA/cm2, we observed only a slight shifting in the CIE coordinates from (0.324, 0.336) to (0.320, 0.326). Moreover, the efficiency of the device with double thin emitting layers of DCJTB is two times higher than the device with only one DCJTB layer.</abstract>

<number>2</number>
<abstract>Multiview displays are characterized by a multitude of parameters, such as spatial resolution, brightness, 3D-crosstalk, and so forth, which individually and in combination influence the visual quality of 3D scenes. These parameters are specified by values precisely measured by optical means. However, it is difficult for an average consumer or content producer to compare the visual quality of two displays or to judge whether given 3D content is suitable for a certain display using only this set of parameter values. In this paper, we propose a quality-measurement methodology that aims to measure the visibility of structural distortions introduced by a multiview display by using a number of test signals with different frequency content and apparent depth. We use these measurements to derive what we call display passband for signals at different disparity levels. The passband determines the frequency components for which the intended signal is predominantly visible with respect to the distortion introduced by the display. Additionally, we propose a method to determine the approximate effective resolution of a display for signals with a given apparent depth. The result of the measurements can be used to compare the perceived visual quality of different multiview displays.</abstract>

<abstract>Liquid crystals stored in vials and bottles are often found to degrade with time, trapping more and more ion impurity in the materials. Here we report on our identification of a major source causing such degradation and illustrate how the electrical properties of an old batch of liquid crystal can be restored by a regenerative agent. This approach, which is demonstrated to be quite efficient, entails simply soaking the agent in the liquid crystal.</abstract>

<abstract>This research is to design a microprism array optical film which can be attached on 2.2-in. liquid crystal displays. The sizes of the base width of the microprism and the sub-pixel of the panel were corresponding. After the selection of the appropriate vertex angles, two images could be delivered to left and right viewing zones of the panel. This research also used flexible material polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with high transmission as the optical film. Besides, it utilized LightTools software to process the ray tracing, which obtained the left and the right images, respectively, delivered to the visual angles of −47.5 to +16.5° and −11.5 to +48.5°. Slight crosstalk only located within −31.5 to −25.5° and +28.5 to +30.5°, respectively. It shows that the microprism sheet can actually make general panels have dual-view display function.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents a waveform for driving a high-resolution AC plasma display panel (PDP) which uses a gas mixture of high Xe content. This waveform drives the PDP with six selective-write (SW) and six selective-erase (SE) sub-fields. The SW sub-fields are addressed using wall charges formed by a modified twin reset (TR) waveform [J.W. Seo, S.H. Kim, S.Y. Soh, J.Y. Kim, J. H. Ryu, B.K. Kang, Twin voltage-ramp reset for high speed addressing of three-electrode AC plasma display panel, Displays 25(2004)49–56, and the SE sub-fields are addressed using wall charges formed by the preceding sustain discharges. A pre-reset pulse is adopted before the beginning of first SW sub-field to prevent the deteriorating effects of remnant wall charges of OFF cell on the addressing of SW sub-fields. When a 10% Xe 42″ XGA (1024×768) AC PDP was driven using the proposed waveform, the required widths of address pulse for the SW and SE sub-fields were 1.2 and 0.9 μs, respectively, and it was possible to display this PDP with the single-scan method. The measured black luminescence, peak luminescence, and contrast ratio were 0.29, 998 cd/m2, and 3440:1, respectively. The measured sustain margins were sufficient for driving the panel with the single-scan method.</abstract>

<abstract>An electrochromic material is one where a reversible color change takes place upon reduction (gain of electrons) or oxidation (loss of electrons), on passage of electrical current after the application of an appropriate electrode potential. In this review, the general field of electrochromism is introduced, with coverage of the types, applications, and chemical classes of electrochromic materials and the experimental methods that are used in their study. The main classes of electrochromic organic and polymeric materials are then surveyed, with descriptions of representative examples based on the transition metal coordination complexes, viologen systems, and conducting polymers. Examples of the application of such organic and polymeric electrochromic materials in electrochromic displays are given.</abstract>

<title>Differentiation in the arched surface of packaging: Its influence on the findability of logo typography displays.</title>

<abstract>Packaging plays a role of protecting the product, attracting consumers’ attention, and communicating the product’s contents. Logo typography is the most important written information of packaging. Among the packaging forms of commodities in the market, cylindrical packaging is in the majority. In the condition that the commodities are highly homogenous, packaging design has become an important factor in marking their difference. For example, changing the arched surface of cylindrical packaging is one of the feasible schemes. However, will different arched surface designs in cylindrical packaging with varied font features affect consumers’ findability of the commodity? We investigated performance of the seven font features of logo typography combined with seven types of arched surface by means of experiment. The results of this study are as follows: (a) Interaction occurs between arched surface with different proportions and varied font features. (b) When logo typography is on the arched surface of a cylinder that has a ratio of horizontal axis to vertical axis between [3:5] and [2:5], varied font features will make significant difference in findability. (c) When the arched surface is greater (i.e. the ratio will become smaller, e.g., [2:5]), the oblong typography is superior to square typography ([Balloon Bd BT (e.g., )]). (d) Optimum findability and discerning performance are achieved when the font feature used is a sans serif structure with equal strokes in thickness, according to the design principle of logo typography. If logo typography is put on the arched surface of an outstanding cylinder (when the visible arched surface is narrower), the fonts with strokes and structure like Script should be avoided as much as possible to keep off low findability.</abstract>

<abstract>A triply doped white organic light emitting diode with red and blue dyes in the light emitting layer and a green dye in another layer is proposed. The device structure was CuPc(12 nm)/NPB(40 nm)/ADN:DCJTB(0.2%):TBPe(1%)(50 nm)/Alq:C545(0.5%)(12 nm)/LiF(4 nm)/Al. Here copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) is a buffer layer, N,N′-di(naphthalene-1-y1)-N,N′-dipheyl-benzidine (NPB) is a hole transporting layer, 9,10-di-(2-naphthyl) anthracene (ADN) is blue emitting layer, tris (8-quinolinolato)aluminium complex (Alq) is an electron transporting layer, 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-t-butyl-6-(1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidy1-9-enyl)-4H- pyran (DCJTB), 2,5,8,11-tetra-butylperylene (TBPe), Coumarin6 and deveriative (C545) are red, blue and green dyes, respectively. This device shows a luminance of 21200 cd/m2 at driving current of 400 mA/cm2 and 1026 cd/m2 at 20 mA/cm2. Its efficiency is 6 cd/A and 3.11 Lm/W. It also shows a higher operating stability: the half lifetime is 22,245 h at an initial luminance of 100 cd/m2, while the driving voltage increased only 0.3 V.</abstract>

<title>Control of inkjet printed profiles by solvent-vapor annealing.</title>

<abstract>The profile of colorant film produced in inkjet printing can be severely affected by the drying environment. This study found that a simple solvent-vapor annealing process can induce a drastic profile rearrangement of the subpixels on the entire substrate. The high surface tension and boiling point of the solvent play a critical role for the rearrangement to occur. The film surface is dissolved during the annealing process, and the high boiling point delays evaporation at the contact edge, which leads to the profile rearrangement. Due to the high surface tension of the solvent, the inks are confined inside the pixels. As a consequence, the profile becomes uniform without any outward color defect, regardless of the printed regions. This will be useful for organic electronics made by inkjet printing.</abstract>

<title>Motion games improve balance control in stroke survivors: A preliminary study based on the principle of constraint-induced movement therapy.</title>

<abstract>Stroke patients with hemiparesis often exhibit an asymmetrical weight distribution, with the paretic leg providing less support and less weight-shift activity than the sound leg does. For upper-limb hemiparesis constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), where the sound limb is constrained and the patient is forced to use the paretic limb, has proven to be one of the most effective rehabilitation methods. However, this method has not been successfully modified for balance rehabilitation, since hard constraints on the lower limb are difficult to impose and can increase the risk of patient injuries. Here we introduce a novel approach that encourages stroke survivors to use the paretic leg for weight-shifting tasks during balance control training in a virtual reality setting. We recorded motion signals from each leg in real time and streamed modified versions of these signals to the Nintendo Wii Fit gaming system. By independently manipulating the influence of each leg during game play, we successfully forced the stroke survivors to increase the use of the paretic leg. Our preliminary clinical trial, including three patients with hemiparesis in the chronic phase, found that one-week of training improved patients’ ability to maneuver their center of pressure (COP) during a tracking task. More encouragingly, patient’s weight distributions became more symmetrical. These initial results suggest that manipulating control gains during VR rehabilitation may allow the principles of CIMT to be applied during balance training in stroke survivors.</abstract>

<abstract>E-book reading devices open new possibilities in the field of reading. More activities than just reading a book can be performed with a single electronic device. For a long time, electronic reading devices have not been favored because their active LCD displays used to have a relatively low contrast. The new generation of electronic reading devices differs from earlier ones in the nature of the display: active LCD displays have been replaced with displays based on e-ink technology, which has display properties closer to that of printed paper. Moreover, e-ink technology has higher power efficiency, thereby increasing battery life and reducing weight. At first sight, the display looks similar to paper print, but the question remains whether the reading behavior also is equal to that of reading a printed book. In the present study, we analyzed and compared reading behavior on e-reader displays and on printed paper. The results suggest that the reading behavior on e-readers is indeed very similar to the reading behavior on print. Participants shared similar proportions of regressive saccades while reading on e-readers and print. Significant differences in fixation duration suggest that e-readers, in some situations, may even provide better legibility.</abstract>

<title>Improvement of color purity and electrical characteristics by co-doping method for flexible red-light organic light emitting devices.</title>

<abstract>This work demonstrates the improvement of the color purity and electrical characteristics for flexible red-light organic light emitting devices (FROLEDs). The devices were prepared by vacuum deposition on ITO-plastic substrates. These guest materials of DCJTB and Rubrene were doped into the host material of Alq3, resulting in an emitting layer. Experimental results reveal that the properties in the above case are better than those of the emitting layer with a single DCJTB guest material, reaching the commercial red-light wavelength requirement of 620 nm. Furthermore, the brightness of FROLED at the concentration ratio [3.0:7] may be two times higher because the presence of Rubrene enhances the effective transmission of energy from Alq3 to DCJTB.</abstract>

<abstract>Based on experimental observation and theoretical analysis, it explicates that light emission of a carbon nanotube-field emission display (CNT-FED) is mainly caused by electron bombardment on the phosphour if the level of vacuum ranges from 10−4 to 5 Pa. In this case, light emission of the phosphour excited by ultraviolet (UV) light derived from gas discharge cannot be observed. If vacuum level is greater than 5 Pa, no emitted light is observed, since a large amount of gas ionisation reduces the electric potential difference between the cathode and the anode. To analyze collision between electron and gas under field emission conditions, a mathematical and physical model was built. Based on this model the number of electron–gas collisions is calculated. Calculations results indicate that the product of gas pressure and distance between the electrodes (pd) is a better parameter to characterize the effect of vacuum level for FED than gas pressure only. Calculations results also show that if the distance between the cathode and the anode is increased, it should be to improve the vacuum level to obtain the same effect.</abstract>

<abstract>This study explored the relationships between automobile head-up display (HUD) presentation image designs and drivers’ Kansei, using quantitative and qualitative analysis. There were two major stages in this study. The objective of the first stage was to find representative Kansei factors from a large semantic space, using factor analysis and cluster analysis. In the second stage, a prediction model for the relationships between the representative Kansei factors and HUD physical image design properties were created, using Quantification Theory Type 1. Results were discussed based on the whole subject population, age differences, and gender differences, respectively. Finally, two existing HUD presentation images on the market were used to test the validity and feasibility of the prediction model, using a one-sample t-test. The results show that our model can successfully predict drivers’ Kansei for a given HUD presentation image. The results can also be used to customize a HUD presentation image which caters to the drivers’ feelings and emotions.</abstract>

<abstract>The practice of evaluating interaction with devices is embedded in disciplines such as human–computer interaction and cognitive ergonomics, including concepts such as affordances, error analysis, skill, rule and knowledge based behaviour and decision making biases. This paper considers the way in which the approach that has been routinely applied to displays and control design within the control and transport domains can be transferred to the context of medical devices. The importance of considering the context in which medical devices are used and implemented is presented, and the need for a systems approach to medical device design is emphasised. Five case studies from medical device control and display design are presented as an aide to developing an understanding of the relationship between device design and resultant behaviours. On the basis of these case studies, four types of mediating factors (catalysts, enablers, facilitators and enhancers) are proposed and a model to describe the link between device design, user, context and consequences is presented.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper, a novel visual secret sharing scheme is presented to hide a secret image into two meaningful cover images which are called share images with no pixel expansion. Simultaneously, the proposed scheme embeds an extra confidential image in these two share images. People who gather the two share images can obtain the secret image by stacking them without any complex computation. After one of the share images is shifted for certain unit, people can get the extra confidential image by their visual system to check the validity of the revealed secret image. Except for sharing binary secret image, the proposed scheme can also be applied to color visual secret sharing scheme to hide color secret image into two meaningful color halftone images without any pixel expansion, and people can derive the extra confidential image for authentication by shifting one of the share images.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper, we introduce a novel colour substitution algorithm based on the dichromatic reflection model. We separate the object colour and scene illumination information in the target area of the original image. The object colour was subsequently substituted while keeping the illumination information unchanged. A new method was employed to estimate the object colour. We also developed a set of new parameters to adjust the intensity distribution on the resultant image. Our algorithm is totally automatic and can achieve more realistic effects compared with other colour substitution methods.</abstract>

<abstract>Effects of doping molybdenum oxide (MoO3) in copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) as hole injection layer in OLEDs are studied. A green OLED with structure of ITO/MoO3-doped CuPc/NPB/10-(2-benzothiazolyl)-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1,1,7,7-tetramethyl-1H,5H, 11H-(1)-benzopyropyrano(6,7,8-i,j) quinolizin-11-one (C545T): tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3)/Alq3/LiF/Al shows the driving voltage of 4.4 V, and power efficiency of 4.3 lm/W at luminance of 100 cd/m2. The charge transfer complex between CuPc and MoO3 plays a decisive role in improving the performance of OLEDs. The AFM characterization shows that the doped film owns a better smooth surface, which is also in good agreement with the electrical performance of OLEDs.</abstract>

<abstract>Glasses within the Bi2O3–B2O3–BaO–ZnO system were examined as potential replacements for PbO-based glass frits with low firing temperatures. These frits are used in the transparent dielectric layer of plasma display panels (PDP). The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the prepared glasses varied between 450 and 460 °C. These glasses display dynamic dielectric properties, high transparency and thermal expansion as well as matching well with substrate glass. The thermal coefficient of expansion (TCE) was with the desired range of 81–86×10−7/K. Moreover, when the screen printed film was heat-treated at 570 °C for 30 min, optical transmittance (83%), root-mean square (rms) roughness (177.6 Å), dielectric constant (10.25) and withstand voltage (4.15 kV) satisfied the requirements necessary for transparent dielectric layers to be used in PDP applications.</abstract>

<title>Adaptive-hierarchical filtering approach for noise removal.</title>

<number>3</number>
<abstract>In this paper, our contribution is to propose an adaptive-hierarchical filter that can remove the impulse noise while preserving the details in an image. The global image structure, which is estimated from a set of pyramid images, can be used as prior information in order to apply different filters adaptively. The proposed filter outperforms other methods in that it can make use of both local and global information efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed method produces better performance than many other well-known methods do.</abstract>

<abstract>A series of ruthenium and iron mononuclear complexes were prepared and their spectroeletrochemical behavior characterized on Optically Transparent Thin Layer Electrodes (OTTLE) and on Fluorine Doped SnO2 (FTO) conductive glasses coated with Sb-doped nanocrystalline SnO2. These systems display a reversible electrochemical response and offer potential application in electrochromic devices. On SnO2 films distinct spectral changes are observed in a narrow potential range (−0.5/0.9 V vs SCE) with switching times of the order of 0.8 s.</abstract>

<title>Visual fatigue caused by stereoscopic images and the search for the requirement to prevent them: A review.</title>

<abstract>Recent literatures related to the evaluations of visual fatigue induced by stereoscopic images (VFSI) are reviewed with the short introduction of cortical mechanisms related to early visual processing, vergence eye movement and lens accommodation. Based on this knowledge, the requirements to prevent visual fatigue and discomfort induced by viewing stereoscopic images were sought. Firstly, the careful alignment in the right/left eye images is required for the stereoscopic vision without discomfort. Secondly, the conflict between the demands for vergence eye movement and lens accommodation in the near response should be avoided, by using modest binocular disparity. Thirdly, the frequency of changes in binocular disparity should be restricted. Finally, the appropriate viewing distance is also recommended to avoid visual fatigue.</abstract>

<number>2</number>
<abstract>Although various alternative control sets have been proposed for various purposes, VCR-like control sets remain the most commonly used for everyday video content navigation by many professional and home users, due to their predominance within popular commercial media players, such as Windows Media Player, QuickTime and RealPlayer. Consequently, this paper proposes a model of user interaction with VCR-like control sets, with the aims of better understanding the process and informing the development of future video content navigation control sets. The model is derived from the results of empirical experimentation. A digital video navigation system with a VCR-like control set was developed and subsequently used by a large sample of users (n=200), who were required to complete a number of goal-directed navigational tasks. Each user's navigational activity was tracked and recorded automatically by the system. Subsequent analysis revealed several patterns of interaction employed by users that were then used to construct the model.</abstract>

<title>A 25-year retrospective review of visual complaints and illusions associated with a monocular helmet-mounted display.</title>

<abstract>In the early 1980s the U.S. Army fielded the first integrated helmet-mounted display (HMD) for use in the AH-64 Apache helicopter. To reduce head-supported weight and minimize center-of-mass offsets, a monocular optical design was selected. Although early design concerns of binocular rivalry and the Pulfrich phenomenon never materialized, user surveys have documented persistent reports of visual complaints and illusions in peacetime training flights. However, a recent evaluation conducted under battle conditions in Operation Iraqi Freedom found statistically lower reports of complaints and illusions. While these reported problems are short-term, questions have been raised regarding potential long-term physiological effects resulting from long-term use of this monocular display. A 10-year longitudinal study, currently underway in the U.K., has been implemented to definitively answer the question of whether long-term exposure produces any degradation in binocular visual function.</abstract>

<title>Intra-visual conflict in visually induced motion sickness.</title>

<volume>32</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>4</number>
<abstract>Motion sickness (MS) can be a debilitating side-effect not just of sea travel, but also when immersed in video games or virtual environments (visually induced MS). To explore the impact of visual display parameters on motion sickness, we presented footage taken on an automobile race track to different groups of observers during three experiments. In Experiment 1, one group watched the movie wearing a head-mounted display (HMD) and a second group looked at a large projection screen with unrestricted view. Resolution and visual angle were equated. In contrast to common assumption, the projection screen produced significantly higher motion sickness scores than the HMD. To understand this rather surprising result, two further groups watched the movie with a limited field of view and reduced display angle, either through a synoptic device or a reduction screen (Experiment 2). Visually induced MS was reduced in both groups to the same extent. In Experiment 3, a fifth group of observers looked at the large screen with a limited field of view, but with unrestricted display angle. Results again showed decreased sickness scores. We conclude that another factor above and beyond display angle is critical to explain visually induced MS, namely the visual surround of the display. If present, the surround increases visually induced MS by causing an additional intra-visual conflict that makes it harder for the visual system to dominate the vestibular information and thus increases the nauseogenic conflict between visual and vestibular information.</abstract>

<title>Highly efficient phosphorescent polymer OLEDs fabricated by screen printing.</title>

<abstract>We demonstrate the use of screen printing in the fabrication of highly efficient phosphorescent polymer organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) based on a green-emitting Ir(ppy)3 and a host polymer PVK. We incorporate PBD in the polymer host as an electron-transporting dopant and α-NPD as a hole-transporting dopant. The best screen-printed single-layer device exhibits very high peak luminous efficiency of 63 cd/A at a relatively high operating voltage of 17.1 V at the luminance of 650 cd/m2. We observed the highest luminance of 21,000 cd/m2 at 35 V. Due to the high operating voltage, despite of the high peak luminous efficiency the peak power efficiency was found to be 12.2 lm/W at the luminance of 470 cd/m2 (15.9 V).</abstract>

<title>The effect of multilayer quantum well structure on the characteristics of OLEDs.</title>

<volume>28</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with multilayer quantum well (MQW) structure were fabricated, which consisted of alternate organic materials 2-(4-biphenylyl)-5(4-tert-butyl-phenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD) and tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3). PBD is used as potential barrier layer, Alq3 used as potential well layer and emitting layer. Compared with double-layer structure, the luminescent characteristics of the devices with MQW structure were investigated. MQW structures conduce to energy transfer between wells and barriers, which is attributed to good overlap and the decrease of the distance between layers. The MQW structures make electrons and holes distribute in different wells and then increase the number of the formation of excitons to further enhance their recombination efficiency. Hence, such device achieves the maximum brightness and efficiency of 3630 cd/m2 and 3.28 cd/A, respectively.</abstract>

<title>A multi-domain vertical alignment liquid crystal display to improve the V-T property.</title>

<abstract>The voltage–transmittance (V–T) property is important for the liquid crystal displays (LCDs). In this work, we propose a sub-pixel structure with two common electrodes of a multi-domain vertical alignment (MVA) mode. The sub-pixel is divided into two sub-areas and different common electrode voltages are applied to it. The optimal voltage difference of the common electrodes between sub-area 1 and sub-area 2 is proposed. The simulated results on the plotted displays and the voltage–transmittance property of the LCD, which has 1:1 sub-area ratio, have been carried out. The results show that the structure can form MVA liquid crystal display mode, such as 8-domain VA mode. It can improve the V–T property at large oblique viewing angle and make the transmittance difference between the normal direction and the oblique direction viewing angle less than that of conventional 4-domain MVA mode.</abstract>

<title>Survey on motion sickness-like symptoms provoked by viewing a video movie during junior high school class.</title>

<abstract>The incident of visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) occurred with a 20-min video movie during class in a local junior high school in Japan in 2003. To investigate possibly contributing factors of VIMS, we collected the incident data in three ways: interviewing school officials, measuring the visual environment on site, and surveying by questionnaires to the students. Analyzing the collected data showed that the students’ severities of the sickness related with their viewing distance to the video image, their concentrations on the video movie, their getting a cold, and their daily playing hours of video games. The results indicated that individual differences are determined not only by one factor, like autonomic nervous activity often focused in the literature, but also by combinations of other personal factors, such as health conditions, watching attitudes, and daily play activities.</abstract>

<abstract>One of the major problems with PM displays is that, depending on the used display material, only a limited number of lines can be multiplexed. We developed a new driving technology and display setup that takes care of that problem. We divided the display into several independent parts or modules. Each module acts as an individual display and has its own display driver. With the use of the new ultra-thin chip package (UTCP), these driver chips can be embedded into the (flexible) display itself. This paper explains the setup of the fully modular display and describes the basic structure of the display drivers and its components.</abstract>

<abstract>A blue organic light-emitting device, based on an iridium phosphorescent dopant in a polyvinylcarbazole host, has been modified by the addition of an external CaS:Eu inorganic phosphor layer. By incorporating a surfactant in the phosphor mixture, a uniform coating could be achieved by drop-casting. The resulting hybrid device exhibited white light emission, with Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage, CIE (x, y) coordinates of x = 0.32, y = 0.35. No significant change in these coordinates was observed for current densities in the range 25–510 A m−2. The maximum power efficiencies of the white device was 2.3 lm W−1 at a brightness of 254 cd m−2.</abstract>

By comparing the electroluminescence (EL) spectra of device driven under different applied voltages, a conclusion can be drawn that the recombination zone shifts logarithmically with increasing applied voltages.</abstract>

<abstract>The current study investigated age-related differences in a steering control task under low visibility conditions. Younger and older drivers were presented with displays simulating forward vehicle motion through a 3D scene of random dots on a ground plane. The lateral position of the vehicle was perturbed by a simulated side wind gust according to a sum of sinusoidal functions. The drivers’ task was to steer the vehicle to maintain a straight path. The visibility of the driving scene was reduced by reducing the quantity and the quality of the optical flow field. We found that performance decreased when visibility was reduced for both older and younger drivers, with better performance for younger drivers as compared with older drivers. An age-related interaction was also found with deteriorated optical flow information. These results suggest that under reduced visibility conditions, older drivers may have increased accident risks due to decreased ability to successfully steer the vehicle.</abstract>

<abstract>The human visual system changes with aging and one of the most important changes is the decrease of spatial contrast sensitivity. We investigated this change both for luminance contrast and chromaticity contrast, and both for threshold contrast and preferred contrast, (preferred by users to carry out a visual recognition task), in a series of psycho-physical experiments with achromatic and chromatic sinusoid gratings of different values of spatial frequency, hue, and luminance level, and with two observer groups: young and elderly observers. We investigated the spatial frequency range of 0.1–10 cycles per degrees. Our results indicate that, beyond the expected luminance contrast sensitivity decline of the elderly observers, the difference between the preferred luminance contrast of the elderly and the preferred luminance contrast of the young is even more significant than the threshold difference. The small preference differences between the age groups for chromaticity contrast compared to luminance contrast suggests that while with increasing age both the chromatic and the achromatic contrast sensitivity drops, preferred contrast stays more stable for chromaticity contrast than for luminance contrast.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper introduces a novel compact approach to measurement and characterization of the visual performance of LCD-screens when high visual fidelity of displayed images is a prime issue. We present instrumentation, procedures and evaluations for assessment of the visual properties of LCD-TV screens with minimum efforts as a basis for a clear and objective rating of their performance. Measurement and evaluation of color and gray-scale fidelity across the viewing-cone and under ambient illumination are the main topics of this paper. Typical results for a high-quality LCD-monitor are presented and discussed. A novel concept for scanning of the viewing-directions with simultaneous acquisition of nine spectra at nine angles of inclination is introduced as a solution for the dilemma of measurement time and colorimetric precision.</abstract>

<abstract>The development of a Microsoft® Excel® spreadsheet is described, for the accurate calculation of CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage) 1931 xy chromaticity coordinates and luminance data from visible region absorption spectra recorded in transmission mode. Using firmly established CIE principles, absorbance-wavelength data from visible spectra recorded using a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer are taken as input, with chromaticity coordinates being generated as output. The colorimetric transformations described are well known to colour scientists, with the methodology and background now being made accessible to the electrochromic materials community. Colour stimulus measurement example calculation results are firstly presented for aqueous solutions of the dyes, Erythrosin B (red), Acid Green 25 and Remaxol Brilliant Blue R, and then for tracking electrochromic in situ colour stimulus changes in the methyl viologen and n-heptyl viologen systems. The quantification of colour during each viologen dication to cation radical reduction process, and each reverse (oxidation) process, showed that subtle changes in both hue and luminance could be detected, with evidence of colour contributions from both the cation radical and the cation radical dimer.</abstract>

<abstract>A non-doped-type pure white organic light-emitting device with high colour rendering index has been reported. The structure of the device is ITO/m-MTDATA (45 nm)/NPB (8 nm)/DPVBi (10 nm)/DCJTB (x nm)/Alq3 (5 nm)/QAD (y nm)/Alq3 (10 nm)/BPhen (8 nm)/Alq3 (45 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al, where m-MTDATA is 4,4′,4″-tris{N,-(3-methylphenyl)-N-phenylamin}triphenylamine, NPB is N,N′-bis-(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-1,1′-biph-enyl-4,4′-diamine, BPhen is 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline, Alq3 is tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminium, DCJTB is 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-tert-butyl-6(1,1,7,7-tetramethyl julolidyl-9-enyl)-4H-pyran, QAD is quinacridone. Through the optimization of x and y, white emission with CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33) at 8 V was obtained, and the colour temperature and colour rendering index were 6712 K and 91 at 8 V, respectively. The Commission Internationale de 1’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of the device change from (0.37, 0.36) at 4 V to (0.32, 0.33) at 15 V that are well in the white region. Its maximum luminance was 27360 cd/m2 at 15 V and maximum power efficiency was 3.16 lm/W at 7 V. Moreover, the current efficiency is largely insensitive to the current density.</abstract>

<title>Virtual reality induced symptoms and effects (VRISE): Comparison of head mounted display (HMD), desktop and projection display systems.</title>

<abstract>Virtual reality (VR) systems are used in a variety of applications within industry, education, public and domestic settings. Research assessing reported symptoms and side effects of using VR systems indicates that these factors combine to influence user experiences of virtual reality induced symptoms and effects (VRISE). Three experiments were conducted to assess prevalence and severity of sickness symptoms experienced in each of four VR display conditions; head mounted display (HMD), desktop, projection screen and reality theatre, with controlled examination of two additional aspects of viewing (active vs. passive viewing and light vs. dark conditions). Results indicate 60–70% participants experience an increase in symptoms pre–post exposure for HMD, projection screen and reality theatre viewing and found higher reported symptoms in HMD compared with desktop viewing (nausea symptoms) and in HMD compared with reality theatre viewing (nausea, oculomotor and disorientation symptoms). No effect of lighting condition was found. Higher levels of symptoms were reported in passive viewing compared to active control over movement in the VE. However, the most notable finding was that of high inter- and intra-participant variability. As this supports other findings of individual susceptibility to VRISE, recommendations are offered concerning design and use of VR systems in order to minimise VRISE.</abstract>

<abstract>The discharge condition of Plasma Display Panel (PDP) changes as the operating time increases. Imaginary part of permittivity of dielectric material which is related to the dielectric loss has been often neglected because of the relatively small values compare to that of the real part. However we have found that some aspect of the long term behavior of PDP is closely related to the dielectric losses. We have studied and compared the thermal characteristics variation and temporal image sticking phenomenon of PDP with two different kinds of dielectrics and correlated with the dielectric losses.</abstract>

<title>The reduction of driving voltage in organic light-emitting devices by inserting step barrier layer.</title>
<pages>119-122</pages>
<year>2009</year>
<volume>30</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>The electron injection and transport in OLEDs have been improved by using a tris-[8-hydroxyquinoline] gallium (Gaq) layer as step barrier between tris-[8-hydroxyquinoline]aluminum (Alq3) (or 4,7-diphyenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Bphen)) and 2-t-butyl-9,10-di-(2-naphthyl)anthracene (TBADN). Since the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of Gaq (2.9 eV) lies in between that of Alq3 (3.1 eV) (or Bphen (3.0 eV)) and TBADN (2.8 eV), step barrier from Alq3 (or BPhen) though Gaq to TBADN can be formed. The experimental results indicate that the J–V characteristics of both the electron-only and the complete devices show the increase of the current density in devices with step barrier compared with the devices without step barrier. For electron-only devices, the driving voltage at the current density of 20 mA/cm2 is reduced from 7.9 V to 4.9 V for devices with Alq3, and from 4.2 V to 3.1 V for devices with BPhen, respectively, owing to the introduction of step barrier. For the complete devices, when Gaq step barrier is introduced, at 20 mA/cm2, the driving voltage is reduced from 7 V to 5.8 V for devices with Alq3 and from 6.2 V to 5.1 V for devices with BPhen. It has also been observed that for devices with step barrier layer, the luminance at 200 mA/cm2 is increased from 1992 cd/m2 to 3281 cd/m2 for device with Alq3, and from 1745 cd/m2 to 2876 cd/m2 for devices with BPhen, respectively. The highest luminance reaches 3420 cd/m2 in devices with Alq3 as ETL and 3176 cd/m2 in devices with BPhen as ETL after the introduction of step barrier. The phenomena are explained by using tunnel theory.</abstract>

<title>A real-time image processor with combining dynamic contrast ratio enhancement and inverse gamma correction for PDP.</title>

<abstract>Inverse gamma correction must be performed before displaying the received video signal because alternating current plasma display panel (AC PDP) has a linear output luminance response to a digital-valued input. At the same time contrast ratio enhancement is necessary for improving the image quality of display devices. The histogram equalization (HE) is an important contrast ratio enhancement method. But sometimes HE can produce unrealistic effects in images. In this paper, a new method of combining dynamic contrast ratio enhancement and inverse gamma correction for AC PDP is proposed. The dynamic contrast ratio enhancement and the inverse gamma correction are realized simultaneously in the proposed method. Furthermore the over-enhancement caused by the traditional HE can be avoided. A real-time image processor with the proposed method was designed and implemented. Simulations and experimental results on a 50-in. AC PDP show that the image quality of AC PDP can be improved obviously.</abstract>

<abstract>InGaN/GaN multi-quantum well (MQW) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with indium tin oxide (ITO) as widow layers were fabricated. The ITO surface was textured utilizing the natural lithography combined with the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching technology by use of polystyrene spheres as the etching mask. The morphologies of the textured ITO surface were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an atomic force microscope (AFM). The electrical and optical properties of surface-textured ITO/GaN LEDs were measured and analyzed. The influence and dependence of ICP etching time on the light output of the fabricated LEDs was investigated. Experimental results indicated that ITO/GaN LEDs with nano-islands with a depth of about 120 nm and a diameter about 320 nm on the surfaces exhibited a ∼60% or more enhancement in the output power. The typical 20 mA driven forward voltage is only 0.2 V higher than that of conventional planar ITO/GaN LED. The fabricated surface-textured GaN LED chips from the whole 2″ wafer presented a quite good conformance in electrical and optical characteristics, and the proposed method demonstrated a good reliability. The results indicate that the surface-textured ITO method utilizing the natural lithography combined with the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching technology has high potential in future large-area high-power GaN LED applications.</abstract>

<journal>Displays</journal>

<abstract>Some viewers of stereoscopic content experience visual discomfort that can be induced or intensified by certain video characteristics such as fast in-scene motion, large changes in disparity and depth discontinuities caused by subtitles. An experiment was carried out to determine the impact of these video characteristics in terms of visual comfort via different measurement methods. Two 3-D movies of approximately 15 min each, both with and without subtitles, were assessed in terms of visual comfort via a continuous assessment and retrospective questionnaires. Analysis of the questionnaire data revealed that subtitles negatively affect how viewers watch stereoscopic movie in terms of general visual comfort items as well as in terms of double vision and sharpness. Via the questionnaires, participants reported that their visual comfort assessment depended primarily on the motion and (changes in) depth in the video content. The scores of the continuous assessment were directly correlated to video characteristics that were derived from the 3-D movies. In line with the questionnaire results, analysis of the continuous assessment scores revealed that visual comfort could be predicted from a linear combination of these video characteristics per scene, yet more complex models are required to extend the comfort prediction to entire movies, incorporating different scenes.</abstract>

<number>4</number>
<abstract>Compared to the conventional hetero-junction OLED (Cell-HJ), a blue OLED with a graded junction in the interface between hole transporting layer (HTL) and emitted layer (EML) exhibited six times higher stability. The study of hole-only devices with graded junction and hetero-junction indicated that graded junction benefit to the hole injection, implying the actual hole barrier decrease. Improvement of lifetime is attributed to the decrease of actual hole barrier, which decrease the produced joule heat in the interface, thus decrease the local aggregation of molecular. However, excess of holes in the device with graded junction caused the decrease of efficiency. In order to increase the electron injection, a step barrier for electron injection was made and the balance of hole and electron was improved, resulting in the increase of efficiency.</abstract>

<abstract>Alternating current thick film light emitters has been prepared by using ZnS:Cu commercial phosphors and thick film technology. The dependence of electroluminescent emission on excitation frequency and voltage applied to light emission devices was studied. Electroluminescent spectra were decomposed into four Gaussians corresponding to emission transitions and their respective peak position wavelengths and amplitudes were analyzed as a function of the applied voltage frequency. The time constants associated to every of those centres have been calculated by determining the extinction times of the related light emission. A straight relationship between electroluminescence extinction time and frequency response for each emission wavelength has been found.</abstract>

<abstract>Phosphorescent white organic light-emitting devices (PhWOLEDs) were fabricated by doping with the blue and yellow phosphors of iridium (III) bis (4,6-(di-fluorophenyl)-pyridinato-N, C2′) picolinate and [2-(4-tertbutylphenyl) benzothiazolato-N, C2′] iridium (acetylacetonate), respectively. The influence of interlayer on the performance of PhWOLEDs was studied with the assistance of three different interlayers consisting of 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BPhen), BPhen mixing N,N′-dicarbazolyl-3,5-benzene (mCP), and mCP inserted between the blue and yellow emitting layers. The results showed that the characteristics of PhWOLEDs were significantly dependent on the selection of interlayers, which tailored charge carrier transport and exciton distribution. Compared with the device without interlayer, the insertion of BPhen interlayer was detrimental to device performance, while the introduction of BPhen: mCP and mCP interlayers was beneficial to the performance. The PhWOLED with mCP interlayer had the highest performance, exhibiting stable white emission with slight Commission Internationale del’Eclairage coordinates variation at a wide luminance range, with a maximum luminance of 46,714 cd/m2, current efficiency of 35.4 cd/A, and power efficiency of 14.5 lm/W. Moreover, the efficiency roll-off was much lower, which was only one third of the device without interlayer.</abstract>

<abstract>This study investigated the effects of figure/background color combinations, the type of computer icon and the figure/background area ratio on visual search performance on a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. Participants had to search for the target item in a circle stimulus array, which had a diameter of 20 cm and included one target and 19 distracters. Results showed that these three independent variables significantly affected the visual search performance. The search times for EMAIL and SAVE computer icons were significantly shorter than that for a PRINT computer icon. Visual search performance was better for computer icons with a 90% figure/background area ratio than for a 70% ratio. However, no difference in search time between 90% and 50% ratios or between 70% and 50% ratios was observed. Color combinations also significantly affected the visual search performance and white/yellow and white/blue color combinations for the figure/background resulted in better performance than black/blue and black/yellow combinations. However, no difference in search time was observed for participants with and without esthetic training. The implications of the results are applicable to design icons for the interfacing of computers and communication information.</abstract>

<title>Influence of ball milling parameters on blue phosphor for cathode ray tube.</title>

<volume>29</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>A series of experiments have been conducted to examine ball milling parameters, such as the size of beads, ball milling time, the ratio of beads/phosphor/water, and the material composition of the ball milling beads to optimize the milling conditions for phosphor powders. It is concluded that longer time, smaller size of Φ2 Al2O3 beads, and higher ratio of beads/phosphor/water = 2:1:0.5 can produce phosphor powder with higher dispersibility which in turn creates a densely packed coating of phosphor particles on the screen, a necessity for high resolution and high cathodoluminescence. When harder material with higher density are applied in the disagglomeration process or lower density beads which have undergone a longer ball milling time, the dispersion result is more effective. Nevertheless, the brightness of phosphor powder may deteriorate, a side effect which is undesirable for high quality phosphor powders. The concept of dispersibility is also proposed by evaluating the sediment volume, hardness, and ratio of water absorption.</abstract>

<abstract>We examined the effect of observer motion on perceived time-to-contact (TTC) with an approaching target simulated on a wide-field display. In Experiment 1, we compared observer motion (OM) alone with target motion (TM) alone, and found that TTC estimates were significantly shorter for OM even though the value of τ was the same in both cases. In Experiment 2, we compared TTC estimates for different combinations of OM and TM, and found that estimated TTC decreased as the proportion of OM was increased. The present data are further evidence that TTC estimates are not based solely on visual cues (e.g., τ) associated with the rate of optical expansion of a target, and further suggest that, for more complex imagery, display-related information such as optical flow can contribute independently to perceived TTC.</abstract>

<abstract>Based on the layered optimization scheme, the inorganic/organic hetero-junction devices were prepared and solid state cathodoluminescence (SSCL) were found. According to this mind, blue SSCL of ZnSe film which is not appeared in the traditional sandwich structure was observed. The relationship between spectra characterization and applied conditions were studied in detail. The luminescence mechanism of the device was discussed. This phenomenon can provide a new way to realize blue inorganic electroluminescence.</abstract>

<abstract>A short review on the current development in all-organic PDLC (Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal) “light valves” using conducting polymer thin films as the driving electrodes is presented in this article. Due to conducting polymers’ better mechanical and interfacial compatibility with plastic substrates, integration of driving electrodes based on conducting polymer thin films in display devices can have some advantages over ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) for the improvement of display devices’ mechanical flexibility. As rigid alignment structures on the substrates sandwiching the liquid crystal components are not required, PDLC-type devices intrinsically can better tolerate mechanical bending than other types of LCD devices. With the integration of conducting polymer thin films as the driving electrodes, it can be expected that the flexibility of PDLC devices could be further enhanced.</abstract>

<abstract>In 3D technology based on the time-division, the time difference exists between the observed images of the left and the right eye. When the moving 3D image is displayed, this time difference can cause the change of the observed binocular disparity and the perceived depth, compared with those of the static 3D images. The amount of the disparity change is investigated in consideration of 3D display and 3D capturing device. Detailed effect and methods of preventing this change are described.</abstract>

<abstract>In this study, attempts were made to develop a reliable and low cost chip on plastic (COP) bonding process by using electroplated Sn bump and non-conductive adhesives. Results showed that the bumped chip was successfully bonded with PES, and the initial average contact resistance was less than 30 mΩ, which is much lower than that of ACF bonding. Thermal cycling (TC) test was performed to study the reliability of the COP assembly. The joints passed over 1000 thermal cycles without failure. The contact resistance decreased and leveled off during the TC test. 30 μm fine pitch joints were fabricated and electrically tested. Microstructure observation disclosed that interfacial intermetallic compound formed at the Sn/pad interface, indicating a chemical bonding was achieved. EDS analysis showed that its average composition was very close to (Cu, Au)6Sn5. During thermal cycling, the interfacial IMC layers were observed to gain dramatic growth.</abstract>

<title>The effects of display delay on simulator sickness.</title>
<pages>159-168</pages>
<year>2011</year>
<volume>32</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>4</number>
<abstract>The experience of simulator sickness (SS) during head-mounted display (HMD) exposure continues to be a problem. The aim of these two experiments was to examine the effect of delay on SS while viewing a real, live video scene via an HMD. An object search task was performed in both experiments. Experiment 1 examined 0 and 200 ms of delay and Experiment 2 examined 0, 145, and 300 ms of delay. SS did not differ as a function of delay. However, SS increased as duration exposure increased in both experiments. In Experiment 1, SS was greater during the first experimental session than the second. SS did not differ between those who donned an HMD and a No HMD control condition in Experiment 2. It is possible that this is due to adaptation to repeated exposure to the sickening stimulus. This adaptation could have confounded the delay effects from Experiment 1. For this reason, a second experiment with an increased intersession interval was conducted. Intersession intervals for Experiment 2 were increased to 11–14 days from 7 days in Experiment 1. However, no effect of delay or session was found in Experiment 2. These results suggested that SS does not increase as a function of delay, but exposure duration increases SS. Also, performing repetitive head movements alone may have elicited symptoms of SS. As reported by other researchers, it appears that adaptation can occur to motion sickness stimuli with intersession intervals of up to 7 days, but not with 11–14 days. Other characteristics of HMD VEs need to be examined because SS occurs and delay does not appear to be as strong of a causal factor as once thought.</abstract>

<abstract>It is important to verify assumptions and methods of image retrieval against actual human behavior. A study was conducted to compare similarity methods of color histograms against human assessment of similarity. The similarity methods tested include basic histogram intersection, center histogram matching, locality histogram matching, and size-weighted histogram matching. 161 subjects participated in the empirical study. The findings, based on Spearman correlation analysis, showed that both the basic histogram intersection method and size-weighted histogram are very close to human assessment of similarity (Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.915). The other two are not close to human judgment on similarity. This study illustrates an alternative approach to evaluating matching algorithms. Unlike the usual measures of recall and precision, this approach emphasizes human validation. Fewer images are required with the use of statistical testing.</abstract>

<abstract>A combined approach for fusing night-time infrared with visible imagery is presented in this paper. Night color vision is thus accomplished and the final scene has a natural day-time color appearance. Fusion is based either on non-negative matrix factorization or on a transformation that takes into consideration perceptual attributes. The final obtained color images possess a natural day-time color appearance due to the application of a color transfer technique. In this way inappropriate color mappings are avoided and the overall discrimination capabilities are enhanced. Two different data sets are employed and the experimental results establish the overall method as being efficient, compact and perceptually meaningful.</abstract>

<title>Manipulation image processing algorithmic technology to realize 1.8" RGBW transflective TFT-LCDs with adjustable colour gamut.</title>

<volume>29</volume>

<number>5</number>
<abstract>This paper presents an adjustable colour gamut RGBW transflective liquid crystal display (ACG RGBW TRLCD), which applies a simple manufacturing process and colour processing algorithm to achieve high brightness as well as appropriated colour performance in both transmission and reflection modes. To rely on appropriating modification in sub-pixel structure design, TRLCD with higher transmittance and smaller colour distortion (average colour shift ΔE < 0.02) in transmission mode has been fabricated successfully. Moreover, with superior reflectance characteristics, the total brightness and colour gamut can also be modified under different ambience. The highest reflectance that has been fabricated successfully for a RGBW 1.8 inches panel is 8.3% with 18.4%, 8.7%, and 4.1% NTSC in reflection mode by using different algorithms. Besides, an evaluation mechanism of colour difference (chromaticity and brightness) is also developed. This not only provides flexibility for any environment but also satisfies a variety of personal hobbies. It is the best technique for both indoor and outdoor uses. And the RGBW technology dramatically improves power efficiency in high resolution displays. Only uses about 50% less power could reach to twice bright.</abstract>

<abstract>In the paper, a new wide color gamut encoding standard of IEC, namely xvYCC, has been extensively studied. To judge a correct volume size of the color gamut, the xvYCC color space has been analyzed in a part of physically possible legal and impossible illegal colors. Within the legal colors, the gamut volume of the xvYCC has been computed in CIE-LAB uniform color space, and compared with theoretical possible optimal colors as all human visible colors in various color spaces of CIE-xy, xvYCC, and CIE-LAB. Because of a color gamut limitation of the optimal surface colors, a new optimal illuminant color space has been introduced for the CIE-XYZ tristimulus sensor. With this, the gamut volume of xvYCC can be better analyzed than before. In addition, the xvYCC color gamut has been compared with the volume of typical three types of CRT-, LED-, and Laser-displays.</abstract>

<abstract>Lag between head movement and the time to render the visual consequences of the movement during head mounted display (HMD) applications presents challenges in the appearance of a stable image. This appearance of an image to “lag” behind or “swim” about may cause detriments in user performance, lack of user acceptance, and simulator sickness. These known potential consequences of HMD use motivated the current work to explore the human capability to detect display lag. The aim in this study was to gain a better understanding of the threshold for display lag detection and what variables affect this threshold.</abstract>

<abstract>In this article, we propose a mechanical rubbing method to eliminate the optical bounce and decrease the response time of homeotropic liquid crystal (LC) cells with sputtered silicon dioxide alignment films. After gently rubbing the inorganic alignment film (sputtered silicon oxide, SiO2), the decreasing polar anchoring energy results in slightly smaller pretilt angle which gives LC a toppling direction to shorten the transition time while LC cell is applied by an external electric field. The results of our work show that this rubbing remedy can suppress the optical bounce. This simple and efficient surface treatment could be applied to liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) technique for high resolution microdisplays and portable electronic products.</abstract>

<abstract>Optical bounce phenomenon often occurs in a multi-domain vertical aligned (MVA) mode liquid crystal display (LCD). It results in the double image edge and motion image blur of the LCD. We find that the optical bounce phenomenon is due to nowadays overdriving method. Some suitable change of the method may eliminate the optical bounce phenomenon.</abstract>

<abstract>This study investigated the effects of bending curvature of simulated e-paper displays (−10 cm, plane and 10 cm) and ambient illuminance (50, 500, 6000 and 12,000 lx) on the visual performance of young and elderly users for simulated electronic-paper displays. In total, 24 people comprising 12 young and 12 elderly users participated in this study. Young users demonstrated significantly enhanced visual performance using the simulated electrophoretic ink (E ink) e-paper display with ambient illuminance set at 50 and 500 lx; however, participants did not demonstrate significantly different visual performance using the 2 simulated e-paper displays with ambient illuminance set at 6000 and 12,000 lx. The bending curvature did not exhibit significant effects on the visual performance of young participants under various ambient illuminances. The elderly participants exhibited significantly enhanced visual performance using the simulated E ink e-paper display only when ambient illuminance was set at 50 lx; however, participants did not exhibit significantly different visual performance using the two simulated e-paper displays with ambient illuminance set at other levels. Elderly users exhibited significantly enhanced visual performance when the bending curvature was set at 10 cm, with ambient illuminance set at 50 lx. Elderly users also demonstrated significantly enhanced visual performance under bending curvature settings of 10 cm and plane, with ambient illuminance set at 500 lx. However, the bending curvature of the simulated e-paper did not exhibit significant effects on the visual performance of elderly participants under ambient illuminance settings of 6000 and 12,000 lx.</abstract>

<abstract>We present a projection system with two liquid crystal on silicon light valves that are illuminated by light-emitting diode light sources (LEDs). The LED illumination system is designed with a fly’s eye integrator. Using this integrator we combine for each primary color two LEDs into one bright source to illuminate the light valve. In the color management system a wire-grid polarizer is used to combine two beams with opposite state of polarization. The contrast behavior of our two LCOS approach is investigated with a basic model and ray tracing. The consequences of using this polarizer are discussed. We present contrast, uniformity and light output measurements of a concept demonstration set-up.</abstract>

<title>The interlaced/progressive scan method to reduce the switching noise caused by data pulse in a plasma display.</title>

<abstract>In plasma display panels, this paper deals with a new scan driving method which can reduce power consumption and which can improve the reliance of driving circuits. The IPS (interlaced/progressive scan) method as a new driving method was proposed and its efficiency was proven by experiments. This method selects a used scan method from interlaced and progressive scan methods in each subfield, according to the input image pattern. From these experimental results, the IPS driving method used less power consumption than the conventional scan method at the special image pattern as a horizontal alternative ON/OFF line pattern. We obtained the maximum decreasing rate of 18.2% regarding power consumption at a special image pattern. In addition, this method improved circuits’ reliance and lowered the amount of heating loss, because this is the driving waveforms of the address electrodes decreased switching noise, which is the high induced overshoot voltage in scan and sustain electrodes or high impulse displacement current in address electrodes. Therefore, we can expect the lower power consumption and reduction of switching noise, which is the overshoot voltage or impulse displacement current, when the proposed IPS driving method is applied to a driving PDP.</abstract>

<title>Increasing social presence of social actors in e-learning environments: Effects of dynamic and static emoticons on children.</title>

<number>4-5</number>
<abstract>The present research aimed to employ dynamic and static emotions as social cues in e-learning environments for computers to be able to convey social presence and increase children’s motivation with learning. To understand how children of different gender react to the two types of emoticon in e-learning environment, a math problem-solving practice program was designed to test their reactions. The program features two treatments, dynamic emoticons and static emoticons. A 2 × 2 (emoticon style × gender) between-subjects factorial design was adopted for this study. One hundred seventy-three sixth graders participated in this study. Data were collected via questionnaire regarding the perceived social presence and children’s intrinsic motivation, and then analyzed by means of two-way ANOVA. The results show that the children in dynamic-emoticon condition perceived a higher degree of social presence and reported greater intrinsic motivation than those in static-emoticon condition. The feelings of social presence created by the computer itself can mediate children’s intrinsic motivation. Besides, no gender differences in children’s attitudes toward computers were observed. It suggests that the use of dynamic emoticons as social cues incorporating in e-learning environments can enable children to perceive computers on social dimension and lead to increase their motivation with learning.</abstract>

<abstract>This study investigated the effects of proportion distribution in web page design on user task performance and subjective preference. Column ratio and screen resolution were examined, in order to enrich our understanding of web page usability. Based on the 960 grid system rule used to divide web page columns, the two variables adopted in the experiment are: screen resolution and column ratio. Screen resolutions of 800 × 600 and 1024 × 768 pixels were examined. Six column ratios were used: 7:93, 15:85, 24:76, 33:67, 41:59, and 50:50. The experiment adopted a within-subjects design. Sixty-one participants were asked to search for a text target. Reaction time and error rate were automatically recorded by software. Repeated measurements revealed that the 1024 × 768 resolution yields shorter reaction times than the 800 × 600 resolution. The 1024 × 768 resolution showed higher subjective preferences than the 800 × 600. With an 800 × 600 resolution, the column ratio of 24:76 yielded the best score. In addition, with a 1024 × 768 resolution, the column ratio of 15:85 produced the best score. A regression equation was used to describe the dependence of reaction time on column ratio levels. Two second-degree polynomial regression equations proved appropriate for describing the subjective preferences of 1024 × 768 and 800 × 600 resolutions at each level of column ratio. The generated results enabled the development of design guidelines applicable to future web page interface design.</abstract>

<abstract>We present a method to give single band intensified nightvision imagery a natural day-time color appearance. For input, the method requires a true color RGB source image and a grayscale nightvision target image. The source and target image are both transformed into a perceptually decorrelated color space. In this color space a best matching source pixel is determined for each pixel of the target image. The matching criterion uses the first order statistics of the luminance distribution in a small window around the source and target pixels. Once a best matching source pixel is found, its chromaticity values are assigned (transferred) to the target pixel while the original luminance value of the target pixel is retained. The only requirement of the method is that the compositions of the source and target scenes resemble each other.</abstract>

<abstract>This study examines the effects of Chinese typography (true type and standard Kai type), speed (171, 260, and 350 wpm), font size (12- and 28-point), and presentation method (serial one word, phrase-oriented, and sentence-by-sentence method) on users' reading comprehension for reading Chinese text on a small screen using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). Scores for reading comprehension indicated that typography style and font size did not significantly affect reading comprehension. Speed and presentation method, however, were significant factors in terms of the reading comprehension. In addition, the interaction between the speed and the presentation method also significantly affected the reading comprehension. When the presentation methods were serial one word and sentence-by-sentence formats, reading comprehension revealed no significant difference under different speed levels. Nonetheless, when the presentation method was in the phrase-oriented format, reading comprehension with a lower speed of 171 wpm was significantly higher than that with the speeds of 350 and 260 wpm.</abstract>

<abstract>The study used the simulated e-paper to investigate how the bending radius of curvature (−10 cm, plane, and 10 cm) and 12 text/background color-combinations of e-paper affect subjects’ visual performance and subjective preference under various ambient illuminance conditions (200 and 500 lx). Analysis results indicated that the bending curvature and ambient illuminance did not significantly affect subjects’ visual performance. However, subjects visual performance differed significantly for different text/background color combinations of the simulated e-paper. When the background color of the simulated e-paper was set to yellow-like condition and the luminance of the text was low (2.2 and 4.6 cd/m2), subjects’ visual performance was best. Regarding the subjective preferences of subjects, the results of this research also demonstrated that the bending curvature, text/background color combinations and ambient illuminance all significantly affected the subjective preferences of subjects. Subjects exhibited the best preference under the following settings: bending curvature of the simulated e-paper set to plane; background color of the simulated e-paper set to yellow-like condition and low text luminance (2.2 or 4.6 cd/m2); high ambient illuminance (500 lx).</abstract>

<abstract>The molybdenum oxide (MoO3) thin layers are used as the hole injection layer in the organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). The surface treatment of MoO3 with ultraviolet ozone (UVO), nitrogen (N2) and argon (Ar) gas plasma have been studied. The turn on voltage is lowered in UVO treated device whereas for plasma treated device the turn on voltage increases. The surface roughness as well as the interface resistance increases with all the treatments. The UVO treated MoO3 device performance and stability enhances; the luminous efficiency by 16% and power efficiency by 14% compared with the reference device. The performance improvement can be explained by the change in work function of MoO3 with UVO treatment.</abstract>

<abstract>A white light-emitting device (WOLED) was fabricated with a solution-processed single emission layer composing a small molecular mixed-host (MH) of N,N′-bis(naphthalene-1-yl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)-benzidine (NPB) and 4,4′-bis(2,2-diphenylvinyl)-1,1′-bibenyl (DPVBi) by codoping blue dye of 4,4′-bis[2-(4-(N,N-diphenylamino)phenyl)vinyl]biphenyl (DPAVBi) and red dye of 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-t-butyl-6-(1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidyl-9,enyl)-4H-pyran (DCJTB) into the MH. White light emission was realized in an OLED with 1.15 wt.% DCJTB and 4 wt.% DPAVBi doping concentrations. A maximum luminance of 13,638 cd/m2 and a current efficiency of 5.7 cd/A were obtained in the device. These results demonstrate that WOLEDs can be realized through solution-processed small molecular emitting layer, which reduced the cost of devices and avoided the complicated co-evaporation of multiple dopants and host materials in the vacuum deposition.</abstract>

<abstract>The luminance variance according to the display load was found to be mainly due to a distortion of the sustain waveform. In particular, the distortion of the rising slope of the sustain waveform according to the display load was shown to affect the sustain discharge characteristics, thereby varying the luminance of the ac-PDP. Therefore, the luminance variation relative to the display load was significantly compensated by proper control of the rising slope of the sustain waveform according to the display load.</abstract>

<title>A low damage GaN-based light-emitting diode with textured/inclined sidewalls and an air-buffer layer.</title>

<volume>31</volume>

<number>2</number>
<abstract>A GaN-based light-emitting diode (LED) with an air–buffer layer and textured sidewalls is fabricated and investigated. After the deposition of a 1-μm silicon dioxide (SiO2) passivation layer on the whole device region except for the sidewall, a hot KOH etching solution is used to develop the desired textured sidewall. Many sidewalls with triangular-like shape are produced along the specific direction of 〈11¯00〉, where photons introduced within multiple-quantum-well (MQW) exhibit more opportunities to scatter into the air. Based on the lateral etching, many triangular-shaped cones are formed on the patterned sapphire substrate (PSS). The device sidewall inclines with a 24° angle which results in an improved reemission of photons in the vertical/lateral direction. At 20 mA, as compared with the LED without KOH treatment, the studied device exhibits improved output power by 11.7% without deteriorating its electrical characteristics. This phenomenon can be attributed to the enhanced output light from vertical and lateral directions due to the formation of an air–buffer layer, textured and inclined sidewalls.</abstract>

<title>120 Hz low cross-talk stereoscopic display with intelligent LED backlight enabled by multi-dimensional controlling IC.</title>

<abstract>This paper proposes to employ multi-dimensional controller for driving LED backlight scanning in a 120 Hz LCD for overcoming the hold-type characteristic of an LCD in time-multiplexed stereoscopic displays. A synchronization signal circuit is developed to connect the time scheme of the vertical synchronization for reducing scanning time. The general strategy is to integrate 3D controller and all relatively small-signal electronic functions into one ASIC to minimize the total number of the components. The display panel, LED backlight scanning, and shutter glass signals could be adjusted by vertical synchronization and modulation to obtain stereoscopic images. Each row of LED in a backlight module is controlled by multi-dimensional data registration and synchronization control circuits for LED backlight scanning to flash in bright or dark. LED backlight scanning stereoscopic display incorporated with shutter glasses is provided to realize stereoscopic images even viewed in a liquid crystal display. The eye shutter signal is alternately switched from the left eye to the right eye with 120 Hz of LCD Vertical synchronization (V-sync). This kind of low cross-talk shutter glasses stereoscopic display with an intelligent multiplexing control of LED backlight scanning has low cross-talk below 1% through a liquid crystal shutter glasses.</abstract>

<title>Efficient organic light-emitting diodes with C<sub>60</sub> buffer layer.</title>

<abstract>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with C60 buffer layer were fabricated. The effect of C60 buffer layer on the performance of the devices was investigated by inserting C60 buffer layer at the interface between the electrode and organic layers. The device structures were (1) ITO/C60 (0.0, 0.4, 0.7 and 1.0 nm)/NPB/Alq3/LiF/Al and (2) ITO/NPB/Alq3/C60 (0.0, 0.4, 0.7 and 1.0 nm)/LiF/Al. The highest brightness and efficiency of the device (1) with 0.7 nm-thick C60 layer reached 6439 cd/m2 at 16 V and 1.80 cd/A at 6.4 V, respectively. The enhancements in brightness and efficiency are attributed to an improved balance of hole and electron injections due to C60 layer blocking parts of the injected holes. On the contrary, the brightness and efficiency of the devices with the structure (2) had been hardly enhanced.</abstract>

<title>Improvement of brightness and efficiency in organic light-emitting diodes using 1, 3-bis(4-tert-butylphenyl-1, 3, 4-oxadiazoyl) phenylene as the hole buffer layer.</title>

<abstract>We have reported the efficient Poly (2-methoxy, 5-(2-ethylhexoxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene) (MEHPPV) organic light-emitting diodes based on 3-bis(4-tert-butylphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazoyl) phenylene (OXD-7) and ITO bilayer anodes. OXD-7 was inserted between ITO anode and MEHPPV and acted as a hole buffer layer. The results demonstrated that the efficiency and brightness of the devices with ITO/OXD-7/MEHPPV/LiF/Al were four factors higher than that of devices with ITO/MEHPPV/LiF/Al. However, the efficiency and brightness of devices with ITO/OXD-7/MEHPPV/Al were worse than that of devices with ITO/MEHPPV/Al. Our results suggested that the better performance of devices should have not only the balance of hole and electron injection, but also higher hole and electron density in the emissive layer. OXD-7, as an electron-transporting material, was demonstrated to be a good candidate for hole injection buffer layer.</abstract>

<title>Ergonomics recommendations for simultaneous and delayed presentation of visual and auditory signals.</title>
<pages>124-131</pages>

<volume>29</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>This study investigated the interaction effects of simultaneous and delayed presentations of visual and auditory signals on reaction times and response errors in a combined auditory-visual setting. The delay between visual and auditory (or auditory and visual) stimuli, and the intensity levels of the auditory signals were varied. In each trial the auditory and visual signals were presented either to the left or right of the subjects, who had to respond to the direction of signal that occurred earliest. It was found that visual stimuli tended to dominate auditory stimuli in the simultaneous presentation condition. However, this visual dominance effect was weakened with increasing intensity of the auditory signal. The visual dominance effect was also found when the two signals were presented with a small delay between them. Signal position, signal modality, signal presentation sequence and warning time were all found to affect performance. Some ergonomics recommendations based on these findings are given with the aim of improving the human–machine interface design in multi-sensory control consoles in order to enhance operator response speed and accuracy and overall system performance.</abstract>

<title>Biologically-inspired heuristics for human-like walking trajectories toward targets and around obstacles.</title>
<pages>105-113</pages>

<volume>34</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>We describe simple heuristics, based on perceptual variables, that produce human-like trajectories towards moving and stationary targets, and around moving and stationary obstacles. Interception of moving and stationary objects can be achieved through regulation of self-movement to maintain a target at a constant eccentricity, or by cancelling the change (drift) in the eccentricity of the target. We first show how a constant eccentricity strategy can be extended to home in on optimal paths and avoid obstacles. We then identify a simple visual speed ratio that signals a future collision, and the change in path needed for avoidance. The combination of heuristics based on eccentricity and the speed-ratio produces human-like behaviour. The heuristics can be used to animate avatars in virtual environments or to guide mobile robots. Combined with higher-level goal setting and way-finding behaviours, such navigation heuristics could provide the foundation for generative models of natural human locomotion.</abstract>

<title>Perception of surfaces from line drawings.</title>

<volume>28</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>We test the perception of 3D surfaces that have been rendered by a set of lines drawn on the surface. Each surface is rendered as a family of curves which are in the simplest case the intersections with a family of parallel planes. On each trial, a surface or its “distorted” version is shown in this way, in an arbitrary orientation on an LCD screen or in a volumetric 3D display. The distortion is produced by stretching the surface in the z-direction by 30%. The subject’s task is to decide whether two sequentially presented surfaces are identical or not. The subject’s performance is measured by the discriminability d′, which is a conventional dependent variable in signal detection experiments. The work investigates the question whether a surface rendered with planar and geodesic curves is easier to recognize than one where the curves are not planar or not geodesic.</abstract>

<title>A pointer device for TFT display screens that determines position by detecting colours on the display using a colour sensor and an Artificial Neural Network.</title>

<abstract>Thin Film Transistor (TFT) screens are replacing traditional Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) screens and are becoming more common in the workplace. Traditional light sensing pens do not work effectively on a TFT screen, as the TFT screen does not generate a scan-line. A novel prototype computer system has been created that depicts where a user is pointing. The new sensor may replace the need for a touch-screen, mouse or keyboard. The system flashes a kaleidoscope of colours onto a TFT screen. A tri-colour photodiode detects these colours. A problem with this solution was the limited number of colours that could reliably be detected by the photodiodes and the time that the colours needed to remain on the screen. This paper describes a new system that includes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the future position of the colour sensor on a computer screen. This information was used to place the optimum colours closest to the sensor in order to increase the accuracy of the reported position.</abstract>

<abstract>In 3D technology, when the image isolation between the left image and right image is incomplete, each eye can see not only wanted image but also unwanted image as well. And for some types of 3D technology, this leakage of the unwanted image is not spatially uniform. In making this leakage less noticeable by the modification of the 3D image data, one value of the modification condition can make the leakage smaller at one position but larger at other positions of the 3D display due to this non-uniformity. When the modification conditions dependent on the display positions are determined and applied to the image data, the leakage is observed to reduce at all the positions of the 3D display.</abstract>

<abstract>Virtual environment (VE) technology exposes users to a variety of intersensory and sensory-motor discordances to which they must adapt for optimal performance. Our research has distinguished two types of adaptation: Visual-motor skill acquisition and perceptual recalibration. The first involves learning a new way to coordinate hand and eye, while the second is an automatic, restricted process of perceptual learning. We conclude that an understanding of the controlling conditions and defining characteristics of these two adaptive mechanisms allows one to predict which is the more likely to occur with a given VE and how best to train its users.</abstract>

<title>Effect of character size and lighting on legibility of electronic papers.</title>

<abstract>Effects of character size under ambient illuminances and light sources on legibility of electronic paper displays (electrophoretic display and cholesteric liquid crystal display) were studied and compared with paper. Sixty subjects participated in a letter-search task in the experiment. The results showed that search speed depends on the illuminance but not light source. Search speed increased as the illuminance increase from 300, 700 to 1500 lx. Search speed also increased with the increase of character size, from character height of 1.4 mm (9.6 min visual angle), 2.2 mm (15.1 min visual angle) to 3.3 mm (22.7 min visual angle), and the increase leveled off at 4.3 mm (29.6 min visual angle). The effect of character size on accuracy was also significant. Accuracy increased with the increase of character size. However, the effect of illuminance and light source on accuracy was not statistically significant. Based on the results of this study, it seems that E-paper displays may need greater illumination (700 lx or higher), greater character size (3.3 mm or 22 min of visual angle).</abstract>

<abstract>The background, theories, and observations on visual stress possibly caused by viewing stereoscopic motion images are reviewed. Visual fatigue caused by stereoscopic images is a safety issue. Fatigue is possible caused by the discrepancy between accommodative and convergence stimuli that are included in the image. Studies on accommodation and convergence are surveyed and an explanation regarding the characteristics of these functions is offered. Studies in the literature on changes in oculomotor function after viewing stereoscopic images, including changes in pupillary responses, are discussed. Evaluation of visual fatigue, particularly in relation to different methods of viewing stereoscopic displays is described.</abstract>

<abstract>Recently, because of the ubiquitous popularization of home video cameras, countless people have had opportunities to watch video images captured by amateur cameramen. Because of this, concerns have arisen over potential negative impacts on viewer health, such as visually-induced motion sickness (VIMS). To determine the mechanism inducing VIMS and to establish a method of preventing it, it is necessary to understand which types of video scenes are associated with the onset of VIMS. Furthermore, while it is useful to consider viewer self-assessments while watching such scenes, physiological indices can provide even more information because they can be measured second-by-second in real time. However, there is not much knowledge regarding the temporal relationships between the severity of VIMS and its accompanying physiological conditions. In this study, the average mutual information was employed to determine the temporal relationship between subjective evaluation scores (a subject’s personal evaluation of his/her own condition) and various physiological indices present when people suffer from VIMS. Our analysis of experimental data found that changes in the two physiological indices, which were respiratory sinus arrhythmia and the maximum cross-correlation coefficient between heart rate and pulse transmission time, had a concordance rate of more than 60% with changes in the severity of VIMS symptoms experienced by test subjects. Furthermore, we determined that it may be possible to detect signs of impending VIMS prior to the development of symptoms by analyzing physiological indices.</abstract>

<abstract>The index of cognitive information difficulty (Dinfo) are measured at the psychological level for the application of learning and design when people are reading and recognizing the Chinese sentences; thus, how to effectively monitor the information difficulty for the purpose of educational learning and design becomes an essential issue. The psychological cognition of the difficulty of sentences experiment is planning to test and verify which one is better of Information Mass (Minfo) and Information Quantity. There has been proof that it is suitable for using the concept of Minfo in meaningful sentences instead of Information Quantity. We can also measure psychological cognition of the difficulty of sentences from subjects. From our study, we have found that the concept of Minfo not only can be use to measure the Dinfo of Chinese characters but also can be use to measure the Dinfo of meaningful sentences. There is significant linear relation between Dinfo of sentences and logarithm of Minfo. In other words, we can infer that the Dinfo of subjects by applying the concept of Minfo. The concept of Minfo not only can be use to measure the Dinfo of Chinese characters but also can be use to measure the Dinfo of meaningful sentences. The authors also establish the qualitative regression model “Dinfo = a + b∗log2(Minfo)”. The concept to apply Minfo gives reasonable explanation to the difficulty of Chinese characters and sentences and the model of linear regression serves the function for the reference of educational learning and design.</abstract>

<abstract>The use of louvers attached to variable information display needs to be optimized taking into account different intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. The analysis of the performance of the display–louvers system takes into account the location, orientation, and daily and seasonal variations. The observation of the system is divided depending on the distance of observation. The far distance vision performance use the background luminance. The medium distance performance needs the use of the Contrast Sensitivity Function of the eye.</abstract>

<title>Visual performance and fatigue in reading vibrating numeric displays.</title>

<abstract>There is increasing use of LCD displays in vehicles and aircrafts. The reading performance of these displays is subject to vibration. Under a software simulated vibrated environment, the study investigated the effect of vibration on visual performance and fatigue for several numerical display design characteristics including the font size and the number of digits displayed. Visual performance and fatigue while identifying the displayed numbers were measured with the reaction time, accuracy, critical Flicker fusion frequency, visual acuity, and subjective evaluation. Both the frequency and magnitude of vibration had significant effects on the reaction time, accuracy, and visual fatigue. Horizontally presented numbers were affected more under horizontal vibration than under vertical vibration. The results showed that whenever the display is used in vibration environment, an increased font size may be an effective way to compensate the adverse effect of vibration.</abstract>

<title>Display configurations in a small footprint clinical driving simulator.</title>
<pages>196-205</pages>
<year>2012</year>
<volume>33</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>4-5</number>
<abstract>Particularly in the health and rehabilitation sector where cost and space are constraints, clinicians need smaller driving simulators. Because of the limited projected field of view (PFOV) afforded by these displays, it was desirable to extend the virtual or geometric field of view (GFOV) beyond that natively afforded by the PFOV. In Study 1, user feedback was gathered from our target user population on two display configurations: (1) a single large LCD; and (2) three smaller LCD screens. Participants were also exposed to four GFOV settings (65°, 80°, 95°, 110°) using either display. The majority of participants preferred and were most comfortable with the three-screen configuration with the highest GFOV setting tested (110°). In order for driving simulation to produce realistic experiences, drivers’ perception of speed should correspond with real world experiences. However, changing the PFOV/GFOV ratio has been shown to alter perceived speed. Therefore, the purpose of Study 2 was to better understand the relationship between speed perception and the GFOV/PFOV ratio in a way that would be useful to simulation practitioners using a small-footprint driving simulator. Using the DriveSafety CDS-250, participants performed a speed matching task using six different GFOV conditions while the PFOV was held constant. Target speeds were presented in three appropriate simulated environments: 25 mph in a residential area, 45 mph in a commercial area, and 65 mph on a freeway. In general, perceived speed was found to decrease with larger GFOVs. However, no GFOV tested produced accurate speed perception; on average, all participants underestimated their speeds using all GFOVs.</abstract>

<abstract>This study aims to measure the multiple visual contrast thresholds on the Mura (a kind of drawback on LCD panels) defects by eyes, so that a common Mura ranking standard was set up from the multiple JNDs to reduce the conflict between the LCD manufacturers and customers. In this experiment, six typical Mura types, negative spacer, positive spacer, line, v-band, light leakage, and curtain were tested, and 25 subjects reported whether the test and the reference patterns were the same or not. From the experimental results, the fitting functions of multiple JNDs for different Mura types were obtained, which were the non-linear curves. Furthermore, the Mura ranking standard system was proposed by finding out the fittest non-linear transformed function, and from which, any Mura defect was assigned to the corresponding Mura rank according to the counted JND value.</abstract>

<abstract>The efficiency and lumen output of light source for illumination system were analyzed based on Etendue, this analytical approach can predict light source collection efficiency. A new method for measuring the output intensity distribution of light source with elliptical reflector was put forward; the collection efficiency vs. Etendue curve was estimated with this technique. The Etendue was changed by moving the mobile aperture gradually and the intensity distributions were recorded by CCD camera in this measurement method. The method is very convenient and the experimental result matches well with the theoretical model.</abstract>

<abstract>We explored the cortical responses to visual collision events that were presented via stimuli that changed in size (looming) or stereo-depth (binocular motion), or both. In particular we examined the differences in cortical response when the looming and binocular cues were congruent or incongruent in the collision information they provided. A stereoscopic goggle system was used within the fMRI environment and allowed us to present looming and disparity cues in isolation, or in congruent or incongruent combinations. Comparison across conditions showed that incongruent cues elicited additional activation in cortical areas know to both process error and locate objects in spatio-topic coordinates. Results are discussed in terms of cognitive and motor responses to seeing incongruent cues.</abstract>

<number>1</number>
<abstract>This study constructed an evaluation framework to obtain the perceptual quality on liquid crystal display-television (LCD-TV) from the user’s point of view. Due to the difficulty for subjects to evaluate too many LCD-TVs simultaneously, the pairwise comparison of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method was implemented in this study. After investigating the relationship between subjective assessments and physical measurements, some useful information can be provided for the industry to improve the quality of LCD-TVs. Results indicated that luminance, contrast and response time are the important factors in selecting an LCD-TV from a user’s point of view. However, after realizing the effect of sharpness, subjects considered that it is the most differentiable factor for selecting an LCD-TV. Therefore, LCD-TV manufactures should emphasize these important factors to improve the quality.</abstract>

<title>Measurement of the mechanical properties of brightness enhancement films (BEFs) for LCDs by optical interferometry.</title>

<abstract>The brightness enhancement film (BEF) is one of the important components in the liquid crystal displays (LCDs). Since the thicknesses of BEFs are very less, it increases the difficulty to measure their mechanical properties. In this paper, we successfully propose a methodology by combining the micro tensile test and optical interferometry to characterize Young’s moduli and Poisson’s ratios of BEFs. In addition, the thermal and hygrothermal effects on the mechanical properties of BEFs were also investigated. The finite element analysis (FEA) was utilized to verify the precision of our proposed methodology. The results show that Young’s moduli of BEFs are influenced by temperature and humidity whereas Poisson’s ratios of BEFs are less influenced by temperature and humidity.</abstract>

<abstract>The column spacer and overcoat layer of the color filter substrate for liquid crystal displays formed at once by capillary force lithography was studied using UV-replica mold and UV-curable liquid resin. The low viscosity and rapid curing speed of the liquid resin make it possible to pattern successfully in the industry application. We can estimate the coating thickness in order to achieve desired overcoat thickness according to mass balance. The formed overcoat layer and column spacer exhibited both satisfied transmittance and recovery ratio for liquid crystal display as commercial these for photo-lithography method. Finally, we demonstrated the panel using this technique and material. This work can provide a possibility for simply and low-cost process to form a functional layer in display.</abstract>

<abstract>Chromatic-stable white organic light-emitting devices (WOLEDs) are reported by combining simple blue fluorescent devices based on a new kind of blue emitter TC-1759 (derivation of N6,N6,N12,N12-tetrap-tolylchrysene-6,12-diamine) with red color conversion layer (DCJTB). By adjusting the thickness of color conversion layers (CCLs), a very pure white light emission with CIE coordinates of (0.34, 0.33) is obtained at the fixed bias of 8 V, and its color temperature is 5036 K. The chromaticity of the device shows a good stability with a slight offset of (0.03, 0.02) at the driving voltage varied from 6 V to 10 V. The maximum luminance and maximum current efficiency achieved 1348 cd/m2 (12 V), and 1.37 cd/A at 3.52 mA/cm2.</abstract>

<abstract>A new type of white organic light-emitting device has been fabricated incorporating a single light-emitting layer of bis(2-methyl-8-quinolinolato) (para-phenylphenolato) aluminum (III) (BAlq) doped with 2,5,8,11-tetra-tert-butylperylene (TBPe) and 5,6,11,12-tetraphenyl-naphthacene (rubrene). The configuration of the device was ITO/PVK:TPD/BAlq:TBPe:rubrene/Alq3/Mg:Ag. By adjusting the proportion of the dopants (TBPe and rubrene) in the light-emitting layer, white light with Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.34, 0.39) was obtained at an applied voltage of 8 V; the change of emission spectra was minimal when the voltage increased from 5 to 20 V. The device exhibited a maximum external quantum efficiency of 0.68% and a brightness of 1020 cd/m2 at 8 V, the brightness increasing to 5723 cd/m2 at 17 V.</abstract>

<title>Design guidance of backlight optic for improvement of the brightness in the conventional edge-lit LCD backlight.</title>

<abstract>An edge-lit backlight as a surface illuminator in the liquid crystal display achieves high brightness illumination with the light-condensing optic, composed of lamps, a light guide plate, a reflection film, a diffuse film, and a brightness enhancement film (BEF). This paper dealt with a technique to improve the brightness of a LCD backlight by increasing the light-condensing efficiency of an existing BEF. First, the technique was proposed; the efficiency of a BEF can be improved by a proper shaping of the angular luminance of lights entering the BEF. Then, its validness was experimentally proved with investigation of the brightness change of a test monitor backlight, varying the angular shape of the incident light to a BEF by adjusting the scattering power of both a diffuse film and an ink material printed on a light guide plate. It was revealed that the improvement range of the brightness by the proposed technique is about 5–9%.</abstract>

<abstract>During recent years, research on colour vision has used traditional visual colorimeters, cathode ray tubes (CRT), and personal-computer controlled LCD-TFT screens to generate chromatic stimuli. We here explore the possibilities offered by a particular family of electronic devices whose use has lately been expanding rapidly, and which have one or more TFT screens and all the hardware needed for portable and autonomous use: handheld game consoles. We considered the different consoles available on the market, and as a result conducted an initial comparative study of two models – Sony PSP and Nintendo DS. As a result of this study, we checked the potential of using the Nintendo DS console, of which more than 100 million units have been sold worldwide. The results of our tests clearly indicated that it can be used as a tool in colour vision and physiological optics at the same technical level as CRT or TFT screens.</abstract>

<number>2</number>
<abstract>This paper reviews the literature on factors that influence the visual (ocular) accommodation response when using see-through virtual image displays (VIDs) such as head-up and helmet-mounted displays. This review suggests that the overall accommodation response is determined by a complex interaction of many factors, some of which are associated with the visual stimulus (such as blur and chromatic aberration) and some of which are cognitive in nature (such as workload and attention). When using VIDs, the effects of these different influences on the accommodation response may not be congruent, leading to the level of accommodation being inappropriate for the task.</abstract>

<abstract>Electrophoretic image displays (EPIDs) are a very promising solution in the search for low-power, paper like reflective displays. While the technology is already mature, little is known about the internal physical properties. In this paper, we will describe which elements contribute to the charge transport and give an explanation of the steady state current. The contribution of the surfactant molecules to the generation current is proven. For the first time temperature dependent measurements on EPIDs were performed.</abstract>

<abstract>A wide-viewing angle twisted-vertical alignment (TVA) liquid crystal display without appearance of disclination lines inside the display area of each pixel has been developed. With simple surrounding protrusion geometry, the liquid crystal molecules present axially symmetric orientation in each pixel when the voltage is applied and thus exhibit wide-viewing angle characteristics. The electro-optic properties of the TVA cell are simulated by the three-dimensional finite element method, and agree well with the experimental results.</abstract>

<abstract>A divergence angle of the light emanated from an optical source composed of a source of light with finite size and a paraboloidal reflector is analyzed on the basis of geometrical considerations. The divergence angle distributions of the reflected light rays from each reflection point on the paraboloidal mirror are numerically calculated as parameters of the shapes of a lamp arc body and a paraboloidal reflector. It has been found from the analyses that the divergence angle can be reduced by prolongation of the optical path length PO to the reflection point P on the paraboloidal mirror from the focal point O of it, at which the center of the extent of the arc is located. A new approach different from conventional one to reduce the divergence angle of the light rays emanated from the optical source is proposed. The new configurations of the optical source composed of a source of light with finite size and a paraboloidal reflector or a spheroidal converging reflector are shown and discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>Immersion in a virtual environment is known to produce symptoms similar to those of motion sickness. With repeated immersions, these symptoms are generally reduced in prevalence and severity. We aimed to quantify this habituation by immersing 70 people on ten occasions each. Ten participants were exposed every day, ten every 2 days, and so on up to every 7 days. The participants played a PC racing game, viewed through a head mounted display, for 20 min. They rated various motion sickness symptoms both before and after exposure, and rated their level of malaise at 1-min intervals during immersion. After completion of the ten trials, all sets of participants reported a marked reduction in the prevalence and severity of the symptoms. The habituation which occurred was of a similar nature in all of the participant groups regardless of exposure interval, indicating that the number of exposures is a more important factor than the time interval between them.</abstract>

<abstract>Some new 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives, 1,4-di(bis(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum-oxy)benzene, abbreviated as Alq(1), and 1,2-di(bis(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum-oxy)benzene, abbreviated as Alq(2), have been synthesized for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) applications. Complexes are thermally evaporable as well as highly soluble in common organic solvents. Bright green photoluminescence (PL) peak appeared in the range of 520–525 nm in solid and solution forms. OLEDs were successfully prepared via both the ways by physical vapor deposition and by spin coating of the complexes. The performance of devices prepared by physical vapor deposition, was compared with that of well-studied Alq3. The device based on Alq(1), showed the brightness of 1400 cd/m2 at 8 V, while only 602 cd/m2 was observed for the device based on Alq3 at the same applied voltage, when the devices were prepared in the identical conditions. Alq(1) device showed the maximum luminous efficiency of 0.94 cd/A at 0.1 A/cm2, while 0.75 cd/A at 0.1 A/cm2, was observed for Alq3 based device. A comparative characteristics study of the new complexes with that of Alq3 revealed that the new complexes are somewhat better than Alq3.</abstract>

<title>Highly efficient styrylamine-doped blue and white organic electroluminescent devices.</title>

<volume>28</volume>

<abstract>We have developed highly efficient blue and white organic electroluminescent devices based on a blue fluorescent styrylamine dopant EBDP. The blue and white organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) with the structures: Indium–tin oxide (ITO)/copper phthalocyanine(CuPc)/N,N′-bis-(1-naphenyl)-N,N′-biphenyl-1,1′-bipheny1-4-4′-diamine (NPB)/2-t-butyl-9,10-di-(2-naphthyl)anthracene (TBADN):EBDP/tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum(Alq3)/LiF/Al and ITO/CuPc/NPB/TBADN:EBDP: 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-t-butyl-6-(1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidyl-9-enyl)-4H-pyran (DCJTB)/Alq3/LiF/Al were studied by using EBDP as blue dopant. For the blue device, the maximum luminance and maximum efficiency were 26961 cd/m2 and 8.29 cd/A, respectively, the luminance at a current density 20 mA/cm2 was 1597 cd/m2. For the white device, the maximum luminance of 32,291 cd/m2, maximum efficiency 8.31 cd/A and the luminance of 1413 cd/m2 at a current density 20 mA/cm2 were obtained. The slow decrease of efficiency with the increase of current density indicates weak exciton–exciton annihilation, which is resulted from the large steric hindrance due to the non-planar structure of the fluorescence dye EBDP.</abstract>

<abstract>Conditions of high and low optic flow were generated in a display used for a driving simulator. Thirty drivers were requested to produce vehicle speeds of either 30 or 60 mph with the geometric field of view at 25, 55, or 85 visual degrees. Drivers overestimated the production of 30 by 20 mph. It was also found that the production of speed was highly dependent on the geometric field of view. These results suggest that optic flow presented in a driving simulator display does not correspond with optic flow found in real-world driving.</abstract>

<title>Visually induced motion sickness: Single- versus dual-axis motion.</title>

<volume>32</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>4</number>
<abstract>The majority of studies into visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) either use complex motion scenarios or are limited to single-axis motion. This study compared VIMS during single- and dual-axis motion. Twelve participants were exposed to (i) oscillating roll motion, (ii) linear motion in the fore-and-aft axis, and (iii) spiral motion, i.e. the summed direction of both of these flow vectors. Increased sensory conflict during exposure to spiral motion was hypothesised to increase the level of VIMS compared with exposure to its constituent motion patterns in isolation. Unexpectedly, spiral motion was not found to be more provocative than either of the two single-axis motion patterns, and this finding appears to be inconsistent with VIMS being determined by simple summation of the provocative stimuli. In the spiral motion condition, an atypical decrease in VIMS was observed during exposure, which was consistently preceded by a reduction in reported vection. It was hypothesised that the abstract nature as well as the unusual motion profile in the spiral motion condition may have rendered the stimulus increasingly ‘improbable’ and ultimately being disregarded, or ‘quarantined’, as an orientation cue by the central nervous system. The results are discussed in the context of methodological consequences for VIMS research and potential limitations of the use of abstract stimuli.</abstract>

<title>The enhancement of the BRCR (Bright Room Contrast Ratio) in a plasma display panel.</title>

<abstract>Luminous efficiency and Bright Room Contrast Ratio (BRCR) are critical issues in a plasma display panel. In the conventional PDP panel structure, an optical filter is used to reduce the reflected luminance and to increase the BRCR. However, this optical filter reduces the peak luminance also, resulting in a decrease in the luminous efficiency. In this study, a new electrode structure with the enlarged black stripe and the auxiliary electrode between the bus and ITO electrode was proposed to investigate the possibility of getting higher BRCR without an optical filter. The experimental results using 3 in. test panels in this study showed that the BRCR of the new structure was enhanced to more than twice of that of the conventional one without any loss of the luminous efficiency.</abstract>

<title>A high-brightness diffractive stereoscopic display technology.</title>

<volume>31</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>4-5</number>
<abstract>In this research, the diffractive blazed grating was proposed to produce the stereoscopic effects that were traditionally generated by barrier grating through parallax barrier method. Three wavelengths, 596 nm, 554 nm and 450 nm, were chosen as the main light waves for three sub-pixels, RGB. Because the diffractive optical element was directly attached to the color filter of a MPEG-4 player (Motion Picture Experts Group Four Player, MPEG-4 player) panel, the stereoscopic image remained high brightness. Since lithography would be the most possible manufacturing method, multilevel approximation was to proceeded during simulation. From the simulated results of optical simulation software, LightTools, the RGB lights moved parallelly and consequently avoiding cross-talk.</abstract>

<abstract>Completely Automatic Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart, or CAPTCHA, is a security measure that guards a system from exploitation by the discrimination between a real human being and an automated computer program via the method of presenting to the unknown user the challenges that are hard for computer yet easy for human. Focusing on text-based CAPTCHA, this study conducted an experiment to study the effect of age groups and distortion types on the CAPTCHA task. Twenty-four participants were recruited to take part in the experiment, where twelve of them were in the elder group (aged 50–56) and twelve in the young group (aged 23–24). One type with no distortion and five types of common CAPTCHA distortion techniques were considered. The results of non-parametric analysis of the data revealed that the participants of two age groups differed significantly in terms of response time, error rate, and NASA-TLX score. Distortion type had significant effect on response time, error rate, Critical flicker fusion (CFF), and NASA-TLX score. Post-hoc analysis showed that Blot Mask and Line Mask were the hardest CAPTCHAs, while Thread Noise, Global Warp, and Geometry Noise were on a par with Normal Type (no distortion). Dependent variables were also correlated to each other. With the inevitability of the security measure and the increasing population of elder internet users, this study has important implications for the design of CAPTCHA systems.</abstract>

<abstract>A high-speed driving technology is currently one of the most observed technologies in the driving AC-PDP. This is a required technology that allows a high image quality. In this paper, we will propose the new driving waveform which has varied Vscan voltage in the same sub-field for the high-speed driving. Therefore, we were obtained 39.5 V as the minimum Vdata voltage at the scan pulse width of 0.8 μs, when the newly proposed driving waveform was applied to a 4-in. test panel. This result was that the minimum Vdata voltage decreased by 14.5 V from the conventional driving waveform.</abstract>

<number>4-5</number>
<abstract>Error-diffusion (ED) is one conventional halftoning technique that converts a gray-level image into a halftone. For further processing the ED halftones, it is often necessary to estimate the original image from the halftone: the inverse of ED. We propose to calculate iterated conditional modes (ICM) for the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution of inverse ED. The ICM always searches for a better estimate in the valid image space. It requires only local computation and is applicable to any type of the MRF model used for the original gray-level images. Experimental results for common standard images are given to show that our ICM performs well and is more flexible than the descent-projection (DP) approach.</abstract>

<abstract>LED-based projectors have numerous advantages compared to traditional projectors. They are more compact, exhibit a larger color gamut and a longer lifetime, the supply voltage is lower and they can even operate on batteries. Despite their optical power per étendue is significantly lower than that of an UHP-lamp, they can be used in low power applications.</abstract>

<number>1</number>
<abstract>A concern for designers of monocular and binocular devices is the ability of users to search for, and localize target items embedded in noisy displays. Twenty-two participants searched (12 under monocular conditions) to localize a target embedded in random gray dot displays. The target was defined by a variation in pattern that did not differ in average contrast from the rest of each display. Displays were presented at .54 and .04 Michelson contrast. Across binocular and monocular viewings, fixation counts increased with decreasing contrast, but the gradient was steeper for monocular viewing. With decreasing contrast, fixations were longer, and the amplitudes of saccades used to localize the target decreased. The findings highlight for monocular vs. binocular target localization, the importance of considering separately, how many fixations are needed to localize the target, and how close to fixation the target must be for it to be noticed.</abstract>

<journal>Displays</journal>

<abstract>In this paper, nanosecond pulsed laser is introduced as a method to pattern the metal cathode of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) without shadow mask or cathode separator. This method can selectively ablate away cathode metal without damage on the underlying indium tin oxide anode or the surrounding organic layers. The width and morphology of laser ablation trenches were studied as a function of energy fluence as well as pulse number of laser. The uniform ablation trench was obtained with 16 pulses at the laser fluence of 0.15 J/cm2. It was found that the characteristics of OLED prepared with laser ablation under optimum ablation process were almost the same with that of OLEDs prepared with other two patterning methods.</abstract>

The Eu(L)3·2H2O on excitation at 354 nm emits bright red luminescent with main peak at 612 nm and Tb(L)3·2H2O on excitation at 354 nm emits bright green luminescence with main peak at 547 nm. The luminescence intensity of Eu(L)3·2H2O is higher than Tb(L)3·2H2O. These complexes emitting red and green luminescence might be used to make the OLEDs for display applications.</abstract>

<abstract>Using a blue iridium complex phosphorescent dye of bis[(4,6-diflourophenyl)-pyridinato-N,C2′)](picolinato) iridium(III) (FIrpic) and a yellow iridium complex phosphorescent dye of bis[2-(4-tertbutylphenyl)benzothiazolato-N,C2,]iridium (acetylacetonate) [(t-bt)2Ir(acac)] as dual ultrathin layers, nondoped white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) were fabricated. By optimizing the thickness of ultrathin layers, the influence of FIrpic and (t-bt)2Ir(acac) dual ultrathin layers on the performance of WOLEDs was studied. The results showed that a stable pure white light emission was obtained with a maximum current efficiency of 11.08 cd/A and a power efficiency of 6.21 lm/W. The Commissions Internationale De L’ Eclairage (CIE) coordinates at (0.33, 0.33) were observed at 9 V bias and showed a very slight variation of (±0.01, ±0.01) in a wide range of voltages. The high power efficiency and stable electroluminescence spectra were attributed to the excitons confined effectively in the recombination zone by the charge trapping effect of dual phosphorescent ultrathin layers.</abstract>

<abstract>We introduce a method to enhance the luminescence of GaN-based LEDs by combining the direct heteroepitaxy laterally overgrowth (DHELO) technique with selective wet etching process. The epitaxial overgrowth of GaN layers on sapphire substrate with SiO2 micro-rods array exhibited a reduced dislocation density and improved the crystal quality. The EL intensity of LEDs with SiO2 micro-rods array was 6.5% higher than conventional LEDs at 20 mA. The selective wet etching process was then used to texture the LED sidewalls into inverted pyramid shape. Finally, the EL intensity could be further enhanced about 12.5% as compared with LEDs with SiO2 micro-rods array when adopting the textured sidewalls.</abstract>

<abstract>A four stages colour management system is developed in order to truly display microscope images on a display and to objectively assess colour properties for cytology samples. By using 35 stained glasses, the colour outputs of two microscopes were simulated. Each stage of the processing was performed and the microscope images captured by two different microscope camera systems were reproduced to a single LCD panel. The management system evaluated was found to be effective in terms of colour image reproduction and could be applied to situations when objective assessment is required.</abstract>

<abstract>Ultraviolet (UV) embossed alignment layers having patterned spacers for the flexible liquid crystal display (LCD) were designed and fabricated to prevent the problems caused by residual monomers in photopolymerization-assisted manufacturing of liquid crystal (LC) devices. UV embossed alignment layers with patterned spacers provided mechanical stability and better alignment properties of LC molecules in a bent environment, compared with LC device with the phase-separated polymer walls. In the patterned spacers of UV embossed LC cell, the column-shaped spacer which has isotropic configuration of spacers provided good LC alignment during bending process.</abstract>

<abstract>A simulator study has been conducted demonstrating a positive effect on airsickness by utilizing a 3D artificial Earth-fixed visual pattern. Participants were exposed to the same turbulent physical aircraft motion in a simulator three times in a row, each time using a different visual cue. In one condition only the interior of the simulator cabin was visible. In another condition an Earth-fixed star field moving opposite the simulator cabin was projected in front of the participant. In a third condition the same star field was used, however with additional anticipatory information by means of a rollercoaster like track showing the trajectory to go. Participants were asked for their misery and joyfulness ratings at fixed time instants using an 11-points misery scale (no problems–vomiting) and joyfulness scale (unpleasant–pleasant). The results showed that viewing an Earth-fixed visual frame moving instantaneously opposite the cabin motion did reduce motion sickness significantly by a factor of 1.6, thereby improving comfort. This condition could be applied in air transport, where often a monitor is available in the back of the seat ahead. The largest effect, i.e., a reduction by a factor of 4.2 was realized by adding anticipatory information. Although it is not possible to predict the effect of turbulence on the aircraft motion yet, an anticipatory display might already be applicable in other domains, such as at sea by using a wave radar and a ship motion model.</abstract>

<abstract>This study investigated the effects of panel arrangement on search performance. The three variables of this experiment were panel arrangement, movement distance, and icon size. Participants were asked to search for target items within a four stimulus array which included: round, horizontal, square, and vertical panel arrangements. Four movement distances were used: √1, √2, √4, and √5. Three icon sizes were examined: 20, 24, and 27 mm. Exposure duration was adopted as the dependent factor which was also treated as the within-subjects factor. Notably, this study is concerned with the user’s icon-clicking distance focusing on two distances, namely, the distance between the start position and the first icon on the panel (P1), and the distance between two icons (P2). Results showed that these three factors of panel arrangement, movement distance, and icon size have caused significant effects on the user’s search performance regarding the two distances mentioned above. Additionally, no difference with regard to search performance was found between the vertical and horizontal arrangements. The results obtained can form design guidelines which are applicable for future human–computer interface design.</abstract>

<abstract>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with multi-layer periodic (MLP) structure, which consisted of alternative N,N′-bis-(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-1-diphenyl-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (NPB) and 4,4′-N,N′-dicarbazole-biphenyl (CBP), were fabricated, where NPB acted as potential barrier and CBP as potential well. Compared with the luminous efficiency of the conventional device with 0-periodic structure, that of the device with the 2-periodic structure has been sharply increased. Such an obvious improvement in the device performance was ascribed to the improvement of the hole–electron balance, due to the introduction of the MLP structure. Moreover, the roll-off characteristic of luminous efficiency and electroluminescence spectra were used to further confirm the conclusion.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper deals with visual–vestibular interactions as these occur when viewing images, and may cause motion sickness. Some basic vestibular matters fundamental to motion sickness are highlighted, such as the observation that people without functioning inner ears do not get sick from motion, including visual motion. Furthermore, the subjective vertical mismatch theory is described, and its corollaries regarding visual motion. A theoretical framework including visual–vestibular interactions is presented. This framework provides opportunities for studying, understanding, describing, and predicting visually induced motion sickness.</abstract>

<abstract>We demonstrated red and yellow organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) with the structure of ITO/NPB/AlQ:DCJTB/AlQ/LiF/Al, where the NPB, AlQ and DCJTB are 4, 4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-henylamino] biphenyl, tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum and 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-t-butyl-6(1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidyl-9-enyl)-4H-pyran, respectively. Electroluminescent (EL) behaviors of these devices have been examined with different concentrations of DCJTB doped into AlQ matrix. The emission color of the devices depends on the doping concentrations of DCJTB. For red and yellow OLEDs, a maximum luminescence of 2750 cd/m2 and 21,700 cd/m2 was obtained, respectively. The peak emission wavelength shift of DCJTB was found to be due to the polarization effects. It is of particular interest that the EL spectrum of DCJTB got broadening with the doping concentrations and current densities of the devices in our experiments.</abstract>

<abstract>An alternating current electroluminescent display has been direct written onto a flexible plastic substrate. A hybrid layer of poly(2-methoxy,5(2-ethylhexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV) and CdSe quantum dots (QDs) were used to convert the light emitted by electroluminescent ZnS phosphor into red light. The emission wavelength of the display is found to be directly related to the emission of CdSe quantum dots. The integration of QDs into thin film electroluminescent (TFEL) displays has the potential to enhance its color spectrum.</abstract>

<title>Synthesis and luminescence of red MEH-PPV: P3OT polymer.</title>

<abstract>This paper investigates the synthesis processes for poly(3-octylthiophene) (P3OT) and poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV). The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and the Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR) were used to identify the chemical structure and functional group of synthesized polymers, respectively. The efficient Förster energy transfer from P3OT to MEH-PPV and the dilution of MEH-PPV with P3OT leaded to an enhanced red emission. When the concentration of P3OT was 30 wt%, the optimal photoluminescence (PL) intensity of MEH-PPV:P3OT was obtained, with wavelength at 580 nm. A PL quenching phenomenon was observed owing to the higher blending concentration of P3OT. The current density was 0.204 A/cm2 at 1.3 V for the red polymer light-emitting diode with the structure of Al/MEH-PPV:P3OT/ITO, and the CIE chromaticity coordinates were at x = 0.66 and y = 0.34.</abstract>

<abstract>In order to develop novel electrochromic materials, a series of N-substituted phenothiazine derivatives (PDs) were synthesized via SN2 reaction and characterized by NMR, IR spectroscopy. Their electrochemical properties were investigated using cyclic voltammetry and their spectrochemical properties were examined by UV–vis spectroscopy. It was found that phenothiazine derivatives in electrochromic devices (ECDs) showed reversible, clear color changes on electrochemical process. An electrochromic effect was observed with a color change from colorless to red or green for the phenothiazine derivatives synthesized. The phenothiazine derivatives synthesized are promising candidate for visible electrochromic devices, for their outstanding electrochromic behaviors plus the inexpensive starting materials and short synthetic routes.</abstract>

<abstract>By optimizing critical parameters including period, thickness, hole shape and diameter, a tri-color filter based on extraordinary optical transmission through periodic hole array on metallic film is designed for OLED display, which shows high purity, narrow bandwidth and large resonant peak in simulation, and experimentally study. Also, its practicability gets confirmed by further verifications in structure’s angle invariance, oblique incidence transmission efficiency and polarized incidence independence. The 0.2 × 0.2 mm2 tiny fabrication scale and as more than 360 periods array dense qualify for UVGA (1600 × 1200) resolution.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper we describe a new Jones matrix, in which the matrix element is the complex exponential. Using this matrix we theoretically study the properties of the cholesteric liquid crystal. It is found that the left-hand circular polarized light of wavelength being equal to pitch of the cholesteric liquid crystal is totally reflected when it propagates along its helical axis and that the right-hand circular polarized light simply transmitted. We also analyze the polarization state of the transmitted light through the cholesteric liquid crystal with different optical pitch. The theoretical analysis shows that the polarization state of the transmitted light will change after the polarized light pass through the cholesteric liquid crystal. Furthermore, we also explain the reason of the selective reflecting of cholesteric liquid crystal for visible light.</abstract>

<abstract>The just noticeable difference (JND) in black level (BL), white level (WL), and chroma as visible in natural images under practical viewing conditions is determined. The same experiments are conducted in China and in the Netherlands to evaluate possible ethnic differences in the size of JNDs. In both countries, there is a strong effect of image content on the JND of BL and WL, while for most images used in this experiment no content dependency is found for the JND of CS. For most images, there is no difference in JND of WL and CS between China and the Netherlands. For some images, we found a difference in JND of BL between China and the Netherlands, but this difference most probably is related to the fact that the viewers looked to a different part in the image, rather than to an ethnic difference.</abstract>

<abstract>This study investigates the permissible value of horizontal binocular disparity when gazing at a three-dimensional (3D) display based on ocular accommodation function. For the closely perceived image on the 3D display screen, the crossed disparity of +1.0° and of +0.5° were given and for the far image, which gave the image far away from the screen, the uncrossed disparities of −1.0° and of −0.5° were taken. The disparity was 0° when the image was displayed on the screen. When the disparity was +1.0° and the stereoscopic image had been perceived, the accommodative response became significantly larger in comparison to that at 0°. An accommodation lead was observed significantly at a disparity +1.0°. The tolerance of binocular disparity on the 3D display based on the physiological aspect of ocular accommodation is thus suggested to be less than +1.0°.</abstract>

<number>1</number>
<abstract>Motion blurring on liquid crystal display (LCD) was modeled by the original image convoluted with a point spread function (PSF). An intensity independent PSF was first deduced by statistical approximation. Based on the PSF, a motion adaptive deblurring filter was proposed to restore the original image. The simulation of motion blurred and deblurred natural images were presented. The results indicate that the proposed deblurring filter can significantly reduce the visible blurring artifact on LCD, which has a simple one-dimensional structure and can be integrated into other video processing algorithms, e.g. frame rate doubling, to further improve the image quality.</abstract>

<title>Effect of strategic accommodation training by wide stereoscopic movie presentation on myopic young people of visual acuity and asthenopia.</title>

<abstract>The abnormal contraction of ciliary muscles due to the performance of a near visual task for several hours causes various vision problems such as asthenopia and visual loss. However, these problems can be resolved by activating the muscles by alternately repeating negative and positive accommodation. In this study, we have verified the effect of accommodation training that uses the strategy of presenting a stereoscopic movie to myopic youth and measuring the uncorrected distant visual acuity, spherical diopter (SPH), a flicker test and subjective index of asthenopia obtained using a visual analog scale (VAS). Stereoscopic movies are prepared by using the POWER 3D method (Olympus Visual Communications Co., Ltd.), which reduces the inconsistency between the experienced and the actual senses. Thirty-two myopic students aged 20 ± 1 years (16 males and 16 females) were chosen as the subjects. One group performed the accommodation training for 6 min, and the other group underwent a near visual task during the same period as the control group. We concluded that the accommodation training using a stereoscopic movie had temporarily improved visual acuity. This training seemed to lead to a decrease in asthenopia.</abstract>

<abstract>Three mixtures of poly(N-vinylcarbozole) (PVK) doped with 3, 1.5 and 0.1 wt% poly [2-methoxy 5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene] (MEHPPV) are prepared. The phase-separation in these mixtures has been observed with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and demonstrated by photoluminescence (PL). The transient electroluminescence (EL) of PVK and MEHPPV in mixed PVK polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) has been measured. The onset of PVK EL driven by electric pulse lagged behind that of MEHPPV in the mixture with 1.5, and 3 wt% dopant. But the EL onsets of MEHPPV and that of PVK in the mixture with 0.1 wt% dopant are the same. Moreover, the lag of EL onset of PVK behind that of MEHPPV increases with increasing doping concentration. The results demonstrate that the resultant carrier mobility of different phases of mixed polymers with low concentration dopant might be differentiated by means of transient EL.</abstract>

<abstract>An all-plastic viologen-based electrochromic device recently developed is electrochemically tested with optic and impedance analysis, revealing its voltage response. An equivalent circuit is proposed to derive the electrical behavior of the material and to relate it with its physical and chemical characteristics. A simple Randles cell achieves the best fitting results for the device operation up to 1.8 V. Diffusion effects become important from 1.1 V to 1.7 V. These fittings will allow future use in displays, in smart glasses for vision impaired people, and other applications, as they will optimize the electronic drivers and signals to be used.</abstract>

<abstract>Organic light-emitting diodes with ultra thin Rubrene layer have been fabricated with the structure of ITO/hole-transport layer/Rubrene/AlQ/LiF/Al. The hole-transport layer are copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystrenesulphonic acid (PEDOT: PSS), poly(N-vinyl carbazole) (PVK), and N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (NPB), respectively. Compared with the other two devices, when 5,6,11,12-tetraphenylnaphthacene (Rubrene) is inserted between PVK (or NPB) and tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum (AlQ), Rubrene’s emission get enhanced. The energy transfer mechanism among PVK (NPB), AlQ and Rubrene are revealed by the absorption and emitting spectra. Moreover, the enhancement of Rubrene’s emission can also be ascribed as an organic quantum well structure’s trap effection.</abstract>

<abstract>In this study, Eu3+ doped Ca(WO4)1−x(MoO4)x phosphors were synthesized via high temperature solid-state reaction. Compared with the Eu3+ activated CaWO4 sample, an increment of MoO3 doping concentration could improve the emission intensity. Improved red afterglow originating from the 5D0 to 7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) transitions of Eu3+ was observed after appropriate amount of MoO3 was added, and the optimal MoO3 doping concentration was experimentally determined to be 0.02. The proposed explanation for the afterglow property was also discussed.</abstract>

<title>A study of image contrast restriction in displays using diffractive spatial light modulators.</title>

<volume>31</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>

<abstract>The peculiarities of 1D projection displays using spatial light modulators (SLM1) are considered. The conditions for high contrast images in SLM are investigated. It is shown that an amplitude imbalance between the light reflected from the passive and active parts of SLM gratings imposes a limitation on the achievable contrast ratio. This imbalance may come from errors in SLM structure sizes and from diffraction effects inside SLM layers. The key point is the relationship between ridge and hole sizes in SLM diffraction structures. It is shown that odd diffraction orders (especially 1st order) have a significantly decreased sensitivity to ridge/hole tolerances. This phenomenon affects the SLM’s contrast ratio. The optimal ridge/hole ratio for different SLM diffraction orders has been found. To test the theory, experimental samples were manufactured and contrast ratio measurements were carried out. The experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical results.</abstract>

<abstract>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with a nickel (Ni)-doped indium tin oxide (ITO) anode were fabricated. The Ni-doped ITO anode was prepared using sputter deposition of Ni–ITO single targets consisting of 1, 3 and 5 wt% of nickel. Turn-on voltage of OLED devices with the Ni-doped ITO anode was reduced by 2.5, 4 and 3.8 V for 1, 3 and 5 wt% targets, respectively. Half-luminance lifetime was improved by 2.5 times with a Ni(3 wt%)-ITO single target. The successful development in preparing Ni-doped ITO films by Ni–ITO single target sputtering allows this approach to be adopted for OLED manufacturing.</abstract>

<abstract>In a typical environment for augmented reality, subjects were asked to detect visual information presented at 15–28° in the periphery of the visual field. Information was displayed tachistoscopically for 200, 300 and 600 ms. Popular low cost beamer producing colour breakup was used to present peripheral stimuli. We found that exposure time affects detectability of targets. By extrapolating our results we compute that for a 100% correct detection the stimulus must be displayed for at least 2 s. Age does not affect detectability.</abstract>

<title>Minimum ambient illumination requirement for legible electronic-paper display.</title>
<pages>8-16</pages>
<year>2011</year>
<volume>32</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>The intent of this study is to determine the minimum ambient illumination requirement for legible electronic-paper display. Not only the young but also the elderly were included as research subjects. Through the method of character-search task, the results indicated that the significant performance improvement of all subjects occurred at 52 lux on the search time and at 62 lux on the subjective visual fatigue. Therefore, the minimum ambient illumination requirement for legible electronic-paper display can be synthesized at 62 lux. This minimum point of ambient illumination for the young and the elderly represents that the reflective-type display started presenting its better legibility and the subjective visual fatigue started decreasing. As electronic-paper display technology applications gradually expand, product designers need notice this fundamental limit of electronic-paper display when they continue to create possible applications in the future.</abstract>

<volume>29</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>

<abstract>This paper presents a new automatic LCD gamma control system using gamma curve optimization for the first time. Since conventional manual method depends on experiences of LCD module developers, it is highly labor intensive and requires several correction steps providing large gamma correction error. Proposed system controls automatically gamma adjustment registers in mobile LCD driver IC to reduce gamma correction error and adjusting time. The proposed gamma system contains module-under-test (MUT, LCD module), PC installed with program, multimedia display tester for measuring luminance, and control board for interface between PC and LCD module. We have developed a new algorithm using 6-point programmable matching technique with reference gamma curve. Developed algorithm and program are generally applicable for most of the LCD modules. It is realized to calibrate gamma values of 1.8, 2.0, 2.2 and 3.0. The control board is designed with DSP and FPGA, and it supports various interfaces such as RGB and CPU. Developed automatic gamma control system showed significantly reduced gamma adjusting time of 4 min. and much less average gamma error of 11% than 42 h and 27% with conventional manual method, respectively. We believe that the proposed system is very useful to provide high-quality LCD and to improve developing process using optimized gamma-curve setting.</abstract>

<title>The viewing angle dependency in the presence of wide field image viewing and its relationship to the evaluation indices.</title>

<abstract>It is well known that presence from video systems increases as the viewing angle increases. Unfortunately, the quantitative evaluation of presence is very difficult. Previous evaluations attempted to determine both subjective and objective assessments. In this paper, we have quantified presence by varying the video system-viewing angle along with subjective evaluations using well-selected matched words and an objective measurement of the viewers' body sway. We have also examined the correlation between the indices used in order to quantify presence. The results indicated that the assessment by subjective evaluation of ‘the sense of presence’ had good repeatability, and that the correlation between the evaluation word ‘presence’ and ‘powerfulness’ was comparatively high but that it was almost zero between ‘presence’ and the total distance of viewers' body sway. This suggested that subjective evaluations using the words ‘presence’ and ‘powerfulness’ were both valid to assess presence, and that the subjective evaluation of presence did not correlate with body sway for each experimental trial, though their means did show comparable tendencies.</abstract>

<title>Evaluation of TFT-LCD defects based on human visual perception.</title>
<pages>1-16</pages>
<year>2009</year>
<volume>30</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>In this paper, we propose an evaluation method of the TFT-LCD defect. Although several detection methods based on image processing techniques detect TFT-LCD defects, the majority of them are un-noticeable to the human eye because of the low contrast and unclear defect boundary. Therefore, to minimize the yield loss, all defects are re-inspected by visual inspector. The proposed method evaluates each defect and gives a corresponding level that objectively agrees with the assessment of a group of inspectors. The basic idea is to use the characteristics of the human visual perception in the evaluation. Crucial features of the defect were selected and the human perception degree was approximated through the regression analysis. In the process, we define the “just noticeable difference surface” (JND) and evaluate the level of defect as the distance from a defect consisting of a vector of selected features to the JND.</abstract>

<title>Efficient vector-oriented graphic drawing method for laser-scanned display.</title>
<pages>97-106</pages>

<volume>30</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>Laser projection, such as that used in laser light shows, usually uses computer-drawn graphics. However, some restrictions are imposed by laser-scanned displays on these vector-based drawings. This paper presents a general vector-oriented drawing method to display computer vector graphics on different laser-scanned displays with optimization. The method considers how to solve the three fundamental problems inherent in laser projection: achieving constant beam intensity, blanking timing and corner overshooting. A velocity parameter has been used to achieve constant beam velocity for all strokes. Blanking timing which is related to turning on/off the laser beam has been examined and a simple test pattern is presented to estimate the total delay that exists in the laser-scanned display and compensate for it. In addition, an optimized approach to avoid corner overshooting and ringing is proposed: the dwelling time of the laser beam at a corner is set according to the corner angle. Moreover, a comparison between the proposed method and the point-oriented method in terms of speed has been presented. It is demonstrated that the vector-oriented approach outperforms the point-oriented approach. Thus, this paper describes the fundamental problems related to laser graphics that must be well considered when drawing with any laser-scanned display.</abstract>

<abstract>This study examined the effects of anti-glare surface treatment, ambient illumination and bending curvature on legibility and visual fatigue in reading electronic papers. Results showed that surface treatment significantly affected legibility and visual fatigue, and surface treatment can improve legibility and reduce visual fatigue under intense ambient illumination. However, there is no significant difference on bending curvature. In addition, due to no significant difference between anti-glare 43% haze and anti-glare 7.5% haze, it is suggested that electronic paper manufacturers may use cheaper options for cost consideration.</abstract>

<abstract>The objective of this paper is to simulate the pixel moirés arising in the liquid crystal display with an image processing technique. The LCD panel and the backlight can be regarded as the micro shutter arrays and the surface illuminator, respectively. The RGB shutters have the spatial periodicity and the illumination lights condensed by a brightness enhancement film (BEF) also have the spatial periodicity depending on the prismatic structure size and orientation of a BEF. Pixel moirés become visible when the spatially aliased periods and amplitudes of illumination lights exceed certain critical values. Avoidance of pixel moirés in the liquid crystal display is a design problem related with choice of prism pitch and orientation of a BEF. In this study an image processing algorithm which can predict the pixel moirés arising in the liquid crystal display was devised, and prediction accuracy was investigated. As a design example, optimal values of prism pitch and orientation of a new BEF having relatively large pitches, 150–200 μm were tried to be found with a devised simulator, and simulation results were discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>Besides usability, visual aesthetics also strongly influence whether users will continue to trust and use a website. This study examined blogs to determine whether a correlation exists between the gender and visual preferences of young people toward blog interfaces. Few research on gender differences in visual preferences for blog interfaces have been published. Therefore the goal of this research is to determine the different design features of blog interfaces preferred by males and females. Using two Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithms, ALSCAL and PREFMAP analysis, the perceptual space of user blog interface preferences was plotted to explore the hidden perceptual configuration of users as well as examine gender related ideal points.</abstract>

<abstract>This study explored the effect of target/background color combination and exposure time on legibility of and EEG response to icons presented on a visual display terminal (VDT). The results showed that color combinations with high preference had better legibility than those with low preference. Peak latency of P100 at visual-cortex area (O1, O2, OZ) showed significantly faster response time with high preference color combinations than with low preference. Mean amplitudes of P300 were significantly greater for short exposure time, i.e., the subjects had greater attention load with short exposure time. In summary, both icon color combination and exposure time had significant effects on the accuracy of icon legibility, and the result was confirmed in EEG analysis.</abstract>

<abstract>This research investigated the effects of text presentation on online behaviour and preferences in order to generate design guidelines for the production of web pages. Previous research has indicated that method of text presentation has a significant impact on usability. The present research found that varying text presentation had a significant effect on task performance, with wider line spacing leading to better accuracy and to faster reaction times. Left-aligned text led to better performance, although participants preferred justified text. Implications of these results for the design of web pages are discussed and recommendations given.</abstract>

<abstract>As a portable mobile device, the e-book reader (e-reader) facilitates text-reading. With the color LCD e-reader employed, this study was aimed to investigate how legibility and visual fatigue are affected by different text directions, screen sizes, and character sizes. Following the experimental method, 60 participants were required to read the Chinese texts in the Ming typeface and to search out the target words in the pseudo-texts. Meanwhile, they were connected to an exclusive database through the Internet. The experimental data, such as the search time, accuracy rate, critical fusion frequency (CFF), and subjective visual fatigue, were recorded in the database as well as analyzed. It was discovered that text direction, screen size, and character size all produced an effect on search time. On the 6″ or 9.7″ screen, 12 pt took the shortest search time. By contrast, the 8.1″ screen was suitable for both 12 pt and 14 pt. Furthermore, the character size exerted an influence on the accuracy rate. 12 pt and 14 pt were suitable for the e-reader on the 9.7″ screen. In addition, the small character size of the text was the main cause of visual fatigue. The results of this study can be used as a reference to design the color LCD e-reader.</abstract>

<abstract>A tactile display is a programmable device whose controlled surface is intended to be investigated by human touch, as a finger is dragged over it. It has a great number of potential applications in the field of virtual reality and elsewhere. In this research, a prototype tactile display incorporating magnetorheological (MR) fluid has been constructed and investigated. Surface force responses of the tactile display under various magnetic fields have been measured while a probe was moved across the upper (controlled) surface. The purpose of this experiment was to simulate the action of a human finger's touch. As the applied magnetic field was varied, the sensed surface profiles changed in synchronisation with the magnet field strength. This preliminary research provides a new practical and effective way of achieving a tactile display without any moving components.</abstract>

<abstract>In PDP, edge-curl is one of the problems encountered as a result of an interaction between the transparent dielectric and the bus electrode, and has a deleterious effect on the electrical efficiency of the PDP. Edge-curl can increase its height while sintering the dielectric. Therefore, it is important to know the effect of the dielectric on the electrode. This study examined the shape change of the electrode as a function of the sintering temperature by scanning electron microscopy. The thermal properties of the electrode and the dielectric were measured by TG-DTA and dilatometer. Based on these results, a faster reaction of the dielectric around the electrode and the difference in shrinkage between the dielectric and the electrode were found to be causes of the occurrence and deepening of edge-curl.</abstract>

<title>The effects of device structure on the performances of distyrylbiphenyl compounds based organic light emitting diodes.</title>

<abstract>The effects of device structure and applied current density on the performances of blue organic light emitting diodes based on unsymmetrical distyrylbiphenyl compounds were investigated. According to the attached functional groups on the unsymmetrical distyrylbiphenyls, two kinds of compounds were synthesized and evaluated: (Z)-4-(2-p-tolylvinyl)-4′-[1-phenyl-2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)vinyl]biphenyl (U-DSB_tBM) and (Z)-4-[2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)vinyl]-4′-[1-phenyl-2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)vinyl]biphenyl (U-DSB_tBtB). As the emission layers of U-DSB_tBM or U-DSB_tBtB thickened, the operation voltage increased and the emitted light became more blue. After inserting a hole blocking layer, the values of the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates were (0.14–0.21, 0.15–0.28). As the applied current increased, the y coordinate of the sample using U-DSB_tBM increased; however, that of the sample using U-DSB_tBtB decreased regardless of the device structure. The X-ray diffraction data and the atomic force microscopy imaging results suggest that the hole mobility of U-DSB_tBM is greater than that of U-DSB_tBtB, indicating that the recombination region is located in U-DSB_tBM at a low current, and that it expands to the electron transport layer at a high current. Therefore, the device structure and mobility affect device performance, and both factors should be considered to optimize the device properties.</abstract>

<abstract>Carbon nanotube (CNT) cathode with and without interfusing nano-metal particles was prepared using screen-printing technology. For the good electric conductivity of metal, the turn-on electric field of the Fe/Ni and CNT composite film (Fe/CNT film) decreases to 1.42 V/μm comparing with the usual CNT film of 2.45 V/μm, and the emission current increases from 60 μA to 440 μA at an applied electric field of 2.3 V/μm. Furthermore, the field enhancement factor β increases from 1721 to 3242. By characterizing the prepared samples via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), it is found that carbide Fe3C phase is formed in Fe/CNT film, and the metal particles are filled in the interspaces of CNTs. It is evaluated that benefiting from good electrical conductivity and chemical inertness of metal carbide, Fe/CNT film achieves high emission characteristics and emission uniformity.</abstract>

<title>Colorimetric color reproduction framework for screen relaxation of projection display.</title>

<abstract>With the mobility developing of the projection display, the images are usually wanted to be projected onto the surround surfaces. Unlike the uniform white screen for the conventional projection display, the surround surfaces are usually colored with the random patterns. Herewith, the existed display technologies always failed on these surfaces due to the disability of the color reproduction. In order that the projection display can also obtain an expected rendering even on the patterned surfaces, a novel color reproduction framework was developed in this paper. This framework was focused on the achievement of the colorimetric color reproduction of the input image and composed of three processes: at first, the colorimetric characterization was accomplished to define the characterization color space and describe the workflow of the color reproduction based on the configuration of the projector–camera system. Then, the reproduction objective was tailored according to the original color of the input image and the reflectance of the surface. Finally, the desired input image was predicted and projected onto the surface to reconstruct the objective image. Several ISO images and printed screens were used to validate the performance of the developed framework. The experimental results demonstrated that the expected objectives could be properly achieved on various projection surfaces for different test images.</abstract>

<abstract>Visual performance and visual fatigue of electronic paper displays (electrophoretic display and cholesteric liquid crystal display) under ambient illuminances and light sources were studied and compared with paper. Forty-eight participants participated in a character-search task in the experiment. The results showed that search speed depends on the illuminance but not light source. Search speed increased as illumination increased from 300 lx (45.6 sec), 700 lx (44.18 sec) to 1500 lx (43.24 sec). The effect of medium display and polarity on accuracy was also significant. Accuracy was greater for electrophoretic display and positive polarity. However, the effect of illuminance and light source on visual fatigue was not statistically significant. Based on the results of this study, it seems that E-paper displays may need greater illumination (700 lx or higher).</abstract>

<abstract>People playing computer games sometimes experience a form of visually induced motion sickness called cybersickness. This phenomenon poses a problem for the entertainment market as well as the practice of training, where serious gaming is gaining acceptance as a new way of training. Although cybersickness can be considered a multifactor problem, the present study focused on the role of Field-of-View (FOV) only and varied two types of FOV in an experiment: external FOV (determined by screen size and viewing distance) and internal FOV (virtual camera angle). For 50 min, we exposed participants to moving imagery generated by a game engine, which generally yielded measurable effects on a misery rating scale. Contrary to what might be assumed, more sickness occurred in conditions where internal and external FOV were congruent than otherwise. We also found a negative effect of cybersickness on postural stability. Finally, we found that on average the severity of cybersickness was less in each succeeding session, pointing to habituation.</abstract>

<abstract>A field-sequential colour projection system can display colour images using a single panel. Such a system, however, produces characteristic trichromatic separation, or “colour breakup”. Colour breakup is the perceived splitting of the white portions of an image into its red, green, and blue components when the image is projected with the colour sequential method and the viewer’s eyes are moving rapidly. Viewing images containing colour breakup may cause visual fatigue and other symptoms of asthenopia. In this study, the authors examine the various subjective symptoms of asthenopia that can be caused by colour breakup.</abstract>

<abstract>An insitu colorimetric method, based on the CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage) system of colorimetry, has been applied to the study of the electrochromic N,N′-bis(n-heptyl)-4,4′-bipyridylium (di-n-heptyl viologen) system in aqueous solution on transmissive ITO/glass substrates. On electrochemical reduction of the di-n-heptyl viologen di-cation, the purple di-n-heptyl viologen radical cation salt deposits as a film and the changes in hue and saturation have been tracked using CIE 1931 xy chromaticity coordinates. The CIELAB 1976 colour space coordinates of the purple di-n-heptyl viologen radical cation salt were L∗ = 76, a∗ = 33, and b∗ = −20, with a complementary wavelength of 548 nm. A sharp decrease in luminance was found on formation of the di-n-heptyl viologen radical cation salt. Colour coordinates for the reverse (oxidation) direction plots show hysteresis, implying that specific choice of colour values depends on both the potential applied and from which direction the potential is changed.</abstract>

<abstract>ClearType is an onscreen text rendering technology in which the red, green, and blue sub-pixels are separately addressed to increase text legibility. However, it results in colored borders on characters that can be bothersome. This paper describes five experiments measuring subject preference, text legibility, reading performance, and discomfort symptoms for five implementation levels of ClearType rendered text. The results show that, while ClearType rendering does not improve text legibility, reading speed or comfort compared to perceptually-tuned grayscale rendering, subjects prefer text with moderate ClearType rendering to text with grayscale or higher-level ClearType contrast. Reasons for subject preference and for lack of performance improvement are discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>A novel red organic electroluminescent diode based on an ultrathin 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-t-butyl-6-(1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidyl-9-enyl)-4H-pyran (DCJTB) layer has been fabricated. The device with the ultrathin DCJTB layer inserted between N, N′-bis-(1-naphthyl)-N, N′-diphenyl-1,1′-biph-enyl-4,4′- diamine (NPB) and tri-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) layers has an emission from both DCJTB and Alq3. When utilizing the 5,6,11,12-tetraphenylnaphthacene (Rubrene) bilayer as the emitting-assistant layer in the fabrication of the device, the emission from Alq3 disappears. We attribute the improvement of color purity to the exciton confinement and energy transfer from the Rubrene molecular. The device with 0.1 nm DCJTB layer has a luminance of 1130 cd/m2 at 20 mA/cm2 with an EL efficiency of 5.6 cd/A, and the CIE coordinates was [0.617, 0.379]. The maximum brightness of this device reaches 21,525 cd/m2.</abstract>

<abstract>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with multiple hole-trapping-layer (HTL) structures, which consist of N,N′-bis-(1-naphthyl)-N, N′-diphenyl-1,1′-biphenyl 4,4′-diamine (NPB), bathocuproine (BCP) and tris(8-hydroxy-quinoline)aluminum (Alq3) have been fabricated. The emitting zone of the device with the structure of ITO/[NPB/BCP]n/Alq3/LiF/Al can be changed by the number n of HTL. The effect of the multiple HTL structure upon the performance of OLEDs with tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum as the emitting material has been investigated. Compared with the brightness of the conventional green emitting diode without the multiple HTL structure, that of the diode with periodic number of five has been increased from 2512.8 cd/m2 to 8661.0 cd/m2. Such an improvement in the device performance was attributed to the improved hole–electron balance, which can be further attributed to the introduction of the multiple HTL structure.</abstract>

<abstract>The sensation of presence or the sensation of “being there” when viewing a video system increases as the viewing angle increases. This relationship has driven the development of wide-field imaging systems. However, visually-induced motion sickness has become an important factor when considering such wide-field video image viewing systems. In the present paper, we evaluate the effects of wide-field video image viewing angle by two subjective and two physiological indices. Motion sickness was induced while subjects viewed vibrating images presented on a Super Hi-Vision display. The results showed that motion sickness as evaluated by a simulator sickness questionnaire increased as the horizontal field of view increased. In addition, the autonomic nervous index demonstrated that viewing vibrating sequences activated the sympathetic control of the viewer.</abstract>

<title>Effect of 2+2 dynamic drive scheme on electro-optical characteristics in cholesteric liquid crystal displays.</title>

<abstract>We have developed and extended the basic idea of 2+2 dynamic driving scheme (DDS) for a VGA (640×480) panel and optimized it to show the ON–OFF switching characteristic. The temperature dependence of selection time of 2+2 DDS is similar with that of 3+2 DDS. The position dependence upon pre and post selection is serious and not suitable for driving the panel. We found that two steps of a propagation period provide the most stable homeotropic state and ON–OFF switching system. With this new driving scheme the potential gray scale for Ch-LCD in a 640×480 pixels matrix was examined. The gray scale can be obtained at a relatively higher voltage. We obtain 32 gray numbers and above 20 potential grays with 40 V of Vpeak and 1.2 ms/line of scan driving time in the VGA panel. Our 2+2 DDS may be useful for foldable display applications, such as for electronic paper.</abstract>

<title>A study on the cognitive of complexity and difficulty of chinese characters when reading and recognizing.</title>

<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>The Index of cognitive Information Complexity (Cinfo) and the Index of cognitive Information Difficulty (Dinfo) are measured at the psychological level for the application of learning and design when people are reading and recognizing the characters; thus, how to effectively monitor the information complexity and difficulty for the purpose of educational learning and design becomes an essential issue. This study combines information theory and Fitts’ Law to propose the concept of Information Mass (Minfo) and through the test of the Cinfo and Dinfo toward the Minfo of Chinese characters, the subjects are surveyed for measuring the complexity and difficulty of 218 selected Chinese characters. The results indicate that there is no significant discrepancy in the Cinfo of genders. The result of regression analysis indicates that the correlation coefficient of logarithm value of Minfo and Cinfo is 0.684 and RSQ equals to 0.468. On the other hand, the Paired-Samples T-test shows the discrepancy of the Dinfo on Chinese characters between and among different groups. Overall, the Minfo threshold value to recognize the Dinfo on Chinese characters between male and female subjects reaches to 0.017; among it, the Minfo threshold value for male and female high school students is 0.06; for male and female university students is 0.01. The average value of Dinfo between genders found in regression analysis indicates the correlation coefficient of Minfo and Dinfo is 0.861 and RSQ is 0.741. From results of this study, subjects are shown to have closer relations between Minfo and Dinfo than that of Minfo and Cinfo. In the other words, the concept to apply Minfo gives reasonable explanation to the difficulty of Chinese characters and the model of linear regression serves the function for the reference of educational learning and design.</abstract>

<abstract>Search times and errors were recorded for targets (a gray triangle or trapezoid) in static marine radar, chart, and radar–chart overlay bitmap computer displays, and for targets in bitmap aerial photo displays. Lossless JPEG and ZIP compressed file lengths were obtained for each display. The two types of compressed file length were correlated and they predicted both the time to search each display and the number of search errors. Search time began increasing with increasing file size before errors began to increase. Compressed file size, an objective, easily obtained measure of display complexity, predicts both subjective complexity judgments (previous research) and objective search performance (these experiments). It is analogous to algorithmic complexity, a theoretical but impractical measure of bit string complexity. The data suggest that it may be possible to use the compressed file size measure to predict display performance in applied tasks.</abstract>

<abstract>The effect of water absorption and thermo-physical properties on the warpage of a diffusing plate fabricated with poly(ethylene terephtalate)/polycarbonate/polybutylene terephtalate copolymer in a direct-lit backlight unit (BLU) of a liquid crystal display (LCD) has been investigated. The warpage of the new diffusing polymer was significantly reduced relative to that of a conventional PMMA diffusing plate. To improve the diffusivity of a diffuser, a new manufacturing technology, a stripe coating method, was suggested. By using this method, scattering characteristics of the new diffusing material was measured and compared to that of the diffuser which was not treated with stripe coating. Spatial profiles of the luminance are displayed for a BLU having cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) array and a flat fluorescent lamp (FFL). As with the superior thermo-physical property that alleviates the warpage, the diffuser plate partially coated with diffusing agents is expected to achieve better uniformity and/or slimmer BLU.</abstract>

<title>Visual-haptic feedback interaction in automotive touchscreens.</title>

<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>Touchscreen interfaces offer benefits in terms of flexibility and ease of interaction and as such their use has increased rapidly in a range of devices, from mobile phones to in-car technology. However, traditional touchscreens impose an inevitable visual workload demand that has implications for safety, especially in automotive use. Recent developments in touchscreen technology have enabled feedback to be provided via the haptic channel. A study was conducted to investigate the effects of visual and haptic touchscreen feedback on visual workload, task performance and subjective response using a medium-fidelity driving simulator. Thirty-six experienced drivers performed touchscreen ‘search and select’ tasks while engaged in a motorway driving task. The study utilised a 3 × 2 within-subjects design, with three levels of visual feedback: ‘immediate’, ‘delayed’, ‘none’; and two levels of haptic feedback: ‘visual only’, ‘visual + haptic’. Results showed that visual workload was increased when visual feedback was delayed or absent; however, introducing haptic feedback counteracted this effect, with no increases observed in glance time and count. Task completion time was also reduced when haptic feedback was enabled, while driving performance showed no effect due to feedback type. Subjective responses indicated that haptic feedback improved the user experience and reduced perceived task difficulty.</abstract>

<abstract>The aim of this study is to investigate the preferences of young children for the dynamic and complexity aspects of images presented to them for English vocabulary learning purposes via an interactive multimedia interface. The experimental data reveal that young children strongly prefer high-complexity images which are entirely dynamic. Therefore, it is recommended that graphical interfaces designed to assist young learners in acquiring new vocabulary items should utilize images of this type to increase their interest, thereby enhancing their learning motivation and performance.</abstract>

<abstract>By adopting augmented reality (AR) and integrating the functions of wireless communication of a personal digital assistant (PDA) and a head-mounted displays (HMD), we built a design evaluation environment that combines a full-scale car display and a visual evaluation system. The image of a car is transmitted via wireless communication onto the PDA, which provides functions for measuring distances and changing parameters of the virtual car using graphical user interfaces (GUI). The updated car image is constructed on the fly on a PC server and sent back to the HMD and the PDA. Multiple users can look at a virtual car simultaneously and discuss its various aspects, enabling better evaluation of the car design.</abstract>

<number>2</number>
<abstract>Stereoscopic projectors show left and right eye information to induce a sense of depth. The viewer wears eyeglasses that separate the left and right eye images using color, shutters or polarization mechanisms. Polarization-based systems can use two identical projectors with passive polarizers at the output of their projection lens. We have designed and built a prototype of a stereoscopic projection system that incorporates the functionality of both projectors and polarizers into one optical engine. Furthermore, the system is adapted to incorporate large color gamut visualization with up to six primary colors. Light emitting diodes with different colors are used as light sources. The optical engine uses two liquid crystal on silicon light modulators to simultaneously modulate one s- and one p-polarized image. Both modulation light paths in the optical engine have a throughput of 10% yielding a total throughput of 20%. In red, green and blue color operation we demonstrate stereoscopic vision wearing polarization sensitive eyeglasses with a 40% increase of the ITU-R BT.709 color space. The images are shown at a frame rate of 120 Hz, producing a total light output of 25 lm, a contrast of 1000:1 and 0.5% crosstalk. We also demonstrate that cyan-colored information can be modulated by the system, which results in a 50% increase of the ITU-R BT.709 color space.</abstract>

<abstract>Efficient color-stable fluorescent white organic light-emitting diodes based on a blue fluorescent host 2-(t-butyl)-9,10-di(2-naphthyl)anthracene(TBADN) co-doped with a blue guest p-di(p-N,N-diphenyl-amino-styryl)benzene(DSA-ph) and a red guest 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-t-butyl-6-(1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidyl-9-enyl)-4H-pyran(DCJTB) were reported. The luminance mechanism was explored by analyzing the characteristics of devices with different doping concentrations. It was found that DSA-ph showed effective assistant energy transfer ability in the system. When 1.5% DSA-ph and 0.5% DCJTB were doped, the energy of the system could be most effectively utilized, achieving a maximum luminance efficiency of 14.26 cd/A at 40 mA/cm2, with a color rendering index of 80. The Commission International de L’Eclairage coordinates changed slightly from (0.3381, 0.3327) to (0.3336, 0.3203), as the applied current density increased from 20 mA/cm2 to 200 mA/cm2. The high efficiency could be attributed to effective utilization of host energy, as well as the depression of concentration quenching, and the color stability may be ascribed to the efficient energy transfer from host to both guests in direct and indirect ways and efficient exciton confinement.</abstract>

<abstract>The objective of this study is to evaluate the usability of electronic books (E-books). An experiment was designed to compare the differences between reading an E-book and a conventional book (C-book) with objective measures. Twenty junior college students, ages sixteen to eighteen, participated in the study. Response measures included reading performance and critical flicker fusion (CFF). The results indicate that reading an E-book causes significantly higher eye fatigue than reading a C-book. Reading a C-book generated a higher level of reading performance than reading an E-book. In addition, females demonstrated better reading performance than males in reading either book.</abstract>

<title>Spatial S-R compatibility of visual and auditory signals: implications for human-machine interface design.</title>

<abstract>This study investigated spatial stimulus–response (S–R) compatibility for visual and auditory signals presented on longitudinally and transversely oriented axes. The objective was to establish data in order to make ergonomics recommendations for multi-sensory interface design in control consoles. The results showed strong stimulus–response compatibility effects. Relatively faster reaction times (RTs) and lower error percentages (EPs) were found for the compatible S–R conditions than for the incompatible conditions. Other than the main S–R compatibility effect, a stimulus–hand (S–H) compatibility effect was also found when there was no clear stimulus–response compatibility. Responses made to visual signals were faster than those to auditory signal, suggesting that the processing of visual signals dominated processing of auditory ones. Response speed increased and accuracy decreased with the adoption of crossed hand posture. Response speed decreased with the length of the warning time interval. The findings in this experiment were translated into practical ergonomics recommendations for signal–response layout, stimulus–hand layout, hand condition, warning time interval, and methods of presenting visual and auditory signals. These recommendations were made with a view to improving control console design in order to enhance operator and overall system performance.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents an energy recovery (ER) circuit which can operate either in a series or a parallel resonance mode and can drive an AC plasma display panel (PDP) with a single sustain circuit board. The proposed ER circuit consists of one energy storage capacitor, two energy recovery inductors, and three insulated-gate bipolar transistors. The circuit operations in the series and parallel resonance modes are similar to conventional ones, except for the leading edge of the first sustain pulse and the trailing edge of the last sustain pulse. To reduce power consumption in the parallel resonance mode of operation, these two pulse edges are generated using a series resonance between the panel capacitance and the energy recovery inductor. The proposed circuit had energy recovery efficiencies in both the series and parallel resonance modes that were nearly the same as the efficiency of the conventional series resonance ER circuit. Experimental results on a 42-inch XGA single-scan PDP show that the proposed ER circuit is suitable for use in a PDP drive circuit.</abstract>

<abstract>In this work, the effects of addition of D2 (Deuterium) in He(70%)–Ne(27%)–Xe(3%) gas mixture on the discharge characteristics were investigated at the pressure of 200 Torr. When the concentration of D2 in He–Ne–Xe gas mixture was varied from 0 to 0.5%, we measured the firing voltage, the sustain voltage, the luminance, the luminous efficiency and the wall charge according to amount of D2, respectively. In the case of a small addition of D2, we have experimentally investigated that the increase of electron due to Penning effect improves an increase of Xe* and Xe2* that emits 147 and 173 nm photons. As a result, when the small addition of D2 in He–Ne–Xe gas mixture, the firing voltage decreased by 9.8%, the sustain voltage decreased by 4.9%, the luminance increased by 19–44%, the luminous efficiency increased by 20–44% and the wall charge increased by 34–45%.</abstract>

<abstract>Nowadays the web map (E-map) is becoming a widely-used wayfinding tool. However, when it is operated with a different input device, its performance will be affected. To investigate its functional performances in various navigation modes, two input devices were employed, i.e., the mouse and the touch screen. Meanwhile, the map websites over the Internet were searched and examined, and three dominant navigation modes in current use were identified: (1) continuous control and continuous display (CCCD), (2) discrete control and continuous display (DCCD), and (3) discrete control and discrete display (DCDD). Then, the experimental interfaces were designed and simulated tests were separately conducted with the mouse and the touch screen to evaluate the performance results. In this research, 36 volunteers participated in the experiment, whose task completion times and user interface actions (total number of clicks on arrow keys) were analyzed through a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the six types of operational performance. It was finally discovered that, in all of the navigation modes, the mouse performed remarkably better than the touch screen in terms of task completion time (F2,70 = 3.28, p < .001). Moreover, the participants did much better in the CCCD mode than in the other modes whether they used the mouse or the touch screen. The findings will be utilized by our research team as the stepping stone to the development of a navigation mode compatible with both the mouse and the touch screen; besides, they will serve as a reference when the web map is further studied and practically designed.</abstract>

<title>Giant-grain silicon (GGS) and its application to stable thin-film transistor.</title>

<abstract>We developed a giant-grain silicon (GGS) by Ni-mediated crystallization of amorphous silicon (a-Si) with a silicon-nitride (SiNx) cap layer. Ni particles were sputtered onto the SiNx/a-Si layer and then it was annealed at around 600 °C. The Ni diffuses through a SiNx cap and then forms NiSi2 crystallites in a-Si, which is able to induce crystallization. The grain size can be controlled from a few to 100 μm. The grain size can be increased with increasing the cap layer thickness or by decreasing the Ni density on the SiNx. The p-channel GGS poly-Si TFT exhibited a field-effect mobility of 101 cm2/Vs and a threshold voltage of −3.6 V and is very stable under gate or hot carrier bias-stress. These superior performances may be due to the smooth surface of GGS poly-Si and solid-phase crystallization of a-Si.</abstract>

<abstract>A tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium doped phosphorescent organic light-emitting diode using a mixed host with stepwise blending profile was demonstrated. We adopted the mixture of 4,4′,4″-tris(N-carbazolyl) triphenylamine and 1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazole-2-yl)benzene as the host in the emitting layer. By using a stepwise blending ratio profile of the two host materials, a peak external quantum efficiency of 17.7% and a peak power efficiency of 45.7 lm/W were attained, which increased by 59.5% and 60.9% relative to the optimal uniform blending ratio profile based device, respectively. The efficiency improvement was attributed to the multiple exciton formation interfaces, which could expand the recombination regions.</abstract>

<abstract>A thin layer of samarium (Sm) was introduced in the cathode fabrication of the organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). An efficient cathode Sm/LiF/Al used to improve the performance of OLEDs was reported. Standard N,N′-bis(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-1,1′-biphenyl 4,4′-diamine (NPB)/tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (AlQ) devices with Sm/LiF/Al cathode showed dramatically enhanced electroluminescent (EL) brightness and efficiency. The optimized device with the 0.5 nm layer of Sm with the cathode structure of Sm/LiF/Al showed the improved power efficiency of 40% than the control device of the conventional LiF/Al cathode at 100 mA/cm2. The drive voltage of the device with the Sm/LiF/Al cathode was decreased about 2 V at 500 mA/cm2 compared with the conventional LiF/Al cathode device. The enhanced properties of the device with such a multilayer cathode are considered to the improved balance of electron/hole injection in the emitting layer.</abstract>

<title>Bipolar drive waveform for long-gap high-Xe plasma display panels.</title>

<volume>31</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>This paper proposes a drive waveform for plasma display panels (PDPs) which have a long discharge gap and use a high Xe-content discharge gas mixture. The proposed waveform uses bipolar sustain pulses, except for the last sustain pulse of each sub-field, to suppress undesired sustain discharges between facing electrodes; these sustain discharges degrade picture quality. The waveform uses a unipolar pulse for the last sustain to reduce the time lag of the address discharge. A reset waveform was designed for the long-gap high-Xe PDP and implemented in the drive waveform. The proposed waveform was tested on a 12% Xe 42-in. XGA (1024 × 768) single-scan AC PDP which had a sustain discharge gap of 180 μm. The measured dark luminance was 0.16 cd/m2, full-white luminance was 284 cd/m2, and luminous efficiency was 1.617 lm/W. The sustain voltage margin was higher than ±10 V at the operating point.</abstract>

<abstract>We examined the effects of two dynamic displays (leading and rapid serial visual presentation), two presentation methods (character-by-character and word-by-word), and three display speeds (150, 250, and 350 characters per minute, i.e., cpm) on users’ reading comprehension under two different task types (single and dual tasks) for reading Chinese text on the screen of a wristwatch. Forty native speakers of Chinese from Taiwan were recruited. Scores for reading comprehension showed that dynamic display did not significantly affect reading comprehension. Presentation method, speed, and task type, however, were significant factors in reading comprehension. In addition, the interaction between presentation method and speed significantly affected reading comprehension. When the presentation method was in a word-by-word format, there was no significant difference in reading comprehension under different speed levels. However, when the presentation method was in a character-by-character format, reading comprehension was significantly higher for the lower speeds of 150 and 250 cpm than for 350 cpm.</abstract>

<abstract>InGaN/GaN multi-quantum well (MQW) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with indium tin oxide (ITO) and Ni/Au p-contacts were fabricated. ITO (500 nm) and Ni/Au (2 nm/9 nm) films were deposited onto p-GaN epitaxial layers by an e-beam evaporation system. For the LEDs using in situ annealed ITO and Ni/Au films as p-contacts, the forward voltage at 20 mA was 3.5 and 3.2 V, respectively. Under the same amount of injection current, the LED with in situ annealed ITO p-contact had higher output electroluminescence (EL) intensity and larger light output power. The EL intensities and the light output power of ITO LEDs were enhanced by 85% and 60%, respectively, at 20 mA. As a result, the light output and power conversion efficiency of ITO LEDs on GaN were greatly improved at high injection currents. The fabricated LEDs were subjected to a stress test at 30 mA and 55 °C and showed a very small degradation of optical power (<1% decrease) for 24 h. The light output of MQW LEDs keeps 80% of the original value after 1000 h stressing. Therefore, the fabricated LED devices have demonstrated a good reliability.</abstract>

<number>3</number>
<abstract>LED PWM dimming application for large scale LED video displays is analyzed. The need for short light pulse duration is outlined. PWM dimming with short driving pulses is investigated experimentally. The LED response time skew introduces the nonlinearity for PWM dimming. For LED response time skew estimation, a method is suggested that has been successfully applied to measure some of today’s market representative LEDs. PWM dimming nonlinearity can be forecasted using the estimated skew. For a particular driving configuration, it is indicated that LED PWM dimming fails to satisfy the required 14 bit output coding together with the image refresh frequency of 400 Hz. A rough investigation demonstrates that the skew is quite stable. Therefore, the nonlinearity correction for the PWM pulse durations shorter than the skew value should be possible.</abstract>

<abstract>How do consumers identify differences among product packages on the shelves of a hypermarket? This issue deserves our investigation. The current study aims to discover the factors in distinguishing bottle packaging and the formula for displayability (ability to display). The research process is divided into two stages. Stage One covers the “grounded concept of package design differentiation,” whereas Stage Two covers the “statistical tests for packaging factors.” We have two findings. First, the participants’ design differentiation of packages is focused on the three differentiation factors: properties of commodity, label design, and design of bottle shape. Second, completed regression analysis proves that their significant levels are all p < .05. We therefore propose a regression model for the assessment of differentiation design for bottle packaging = 0.717 × properties of commodity + 0.708 × design of bottle shape + 0.795 × label design − 2.857. The three factors rank in importance as properties of commodity > design of bottle shape > label design. These results can help marketing and design personnel compare the difference in the package design of competitive products before they enter the market in order to create differentiation and build brand identity.</abstract>

<abstract>This study attempts to demonstrate the respective effects of time-based and environment-based factors in visual fatigue and task performance for a dynamic VDT work. Two experiments were conducted in the current study. Experiment 1 involved 10 participants tracking a scanning line at two different scanning speeds, and responding to a designated target presented singly at two different temporal frequencies. Experiment 2 involved 10 participants tracking a target with changing screen type and viewing distance. The observation results indicated that scanning speed, target presentation rate, and work period (time-based factors) significantly affected visual acuity, critical fusion frequency (CFF) and accommodative power. Screen type and viewing distance (environment-based factors) also had a significant main effect on visual acuity, CFF, accommodative power, and reaction time. This study concluded that time-based and environment-based factors influence operator visual fatigue and task performance during dynamic VDT work.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper we investigate human binocular depth perception on 3D electronic display technologies. Our study is motivated by the increasing use of 3D displays in applications, including geo-science and medicine, where critical decisions are made using fine binocular depth judgements. We predict subject performance for a depth judgement task using published specifications for seven different 3D displays. A repeated measures, within subjects experimental design is used to determine the effect that display and binocular disparity have on subject scores in the task. We find that there is reliable variation in participant performance with display and disparity, however this variation is not always consistent with our predictions from the display specifications. We also present subjective results that suggest user preference for a 3D display is not always a reliable guide to their ability to perform the task. We conclude that care must be taken in selecting 3D display systems for tasks that critically rely on human depth judgement.</abstract>

<abstract>Some people experience visual discomfort when watching stereoscopic content, which to a large extent can be predicted by their binocular visual status. Earlier research has proven that the binocular status can be assessed by the difference in reading speed between 2-D and 3-D. In this paper, we further substantiate the evidence for a tool to screen people on their susceptibility to such visual complaints based on this reading speed difference.</abstract>

<abstract>An adaptive address energy recovery circuits (AAERCs) for plasma display panels (PDPs) is proposed after analyzing the address power of address methods such as the address energy recovery circuits (AERCs), no-AERC, and interlaced/progressive scan (IPS). Also the detecting method for change rate of address data to calculate address power is proposed. Then AAERCs can work as AERCs, no-AERCs, or IPS in one subfield according to calculating result of address power to get the lowest address power comparing with other methods. There is no change on prototype address circuit but only control timing of scan ICs and address data processing in software. The experiment results with a 50-in. HD dual-scan PDP shows that the address power of AAERCs can keep the lowest at any picture comparing with other address methods, and the maximum address power saved is 81 W.</abstract>

<volume>31</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>The reversible image steganographic scheme in this study provides the ability to embed secret data into a host image and then recover the host image without losing any information when the secret data is extracted. In this paper, a reversible image steganographic scheme based on predictive coding is proposed by embedding secret data into compression codes during the lossless image compression. The proposed scheme effectively provides a lossless hiding mechanism in the compression domain. During the predictive coding stage, the proposed scheme embeds secret data into error values by referring to a hiding-tree. In an entropy decoding stage, the secret data can be extracted by referring to the hiding-tree, and the host image can be recovered during the predictive decoding stage. The experimental results show that the average hiding capacity of the proposed scheme is 0.992 bits per pixel (bpp), and the host image can be reconstructed without losing any information when the secret data is extracted.</abstract>

<abstract>This study investigated the effects of light source, ambient illuminance, character size, and interline spacing on visual performance and visual fatigue in using commercial electronic paper displays. Regarding visual performance the results showed that display type, character size, interline spacing had significant effects on search time. Electrophoretic electronic ink display had a shorter search time than chlorestic liquid crystal display. Searching time decreased as character size and interline spacing increased. Ambient illumination, display type, character size, and interline spacing had significant effects on accuracy. Accuracy was highest for 1500 lx ambient illumination. Accuracy of electrophoretic electronic ink display was greater than chlorestic liquid crystal display. Accuracy increased as character size and interline spacing increased. Regarding visual fatigue, results showed that light source and ambient illumination had non-significant effects on change of critical flicker fusion (CFF) and subjective visual fatigue. Results could be able to provide some guidelines for consumers to choose a suitable electronic paper according to lighting condition and set appropriate character size and interline spacing.</abstract>

<title>Analysing user physiological responses for affective video summarisation.</title>
<pages>59-70</pages>
<year>2009</year>
<volume>30</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>Video summarisation techniques aim to abstract the most significant content from a video stream. This is typically achieved by processing low-level image, audio and text features which are still quite disparate from the high-level semantics that end users identify with (the ‘semantic gap’). Physiological responses are potentially rich indicators of memorable or emotionally engaging video content for a given user. Consequently, we investigate whether they may serve as a suitable basis for a video summarisation technique by analysing a range of user physiological response measures, specifically electro-dermal response (EDR), respiration amplitude (RA), respiration rate (RR), blood volume pulse (BVP) and heart rate (HR), in response to a range of video content in a variety of genres including horror, comedy, drama, sci-fi and action. We present an analysis framework for processing the user responses to specific sub-segments within a video stream based on percent rank value normalisation. The application of the analysis framework reveals that users respond significantly to the most entertaining video sub-segments in a range of content domains. Specifically, horror content seems to elicit significant EDR, RA, RR and BVP responses, and comedy content elicits comparatively lower levels of EDR, but does seem to elicit significant RA, RR, BVP and HR responses. Drama content seems to elicit less significant physiological responses in general, and both sci-fi and action content seem to elicit significant EDR responses. We discuss the implications this may have for future affective video summarisation approaches.</abstract>

<title>Exploiting perceptual limitations and illusions to support walking through virtual environments in confined physical spaces.</title>

<journal>Displays</journal>

<abstract>Head-mounted displays (HMDs) allow users to immerse in a virtual environment (VE) in which the user’s viewpoint can be changed according to the tracked movements in real space. Because the size of the virtual world often differs from the size of the tracked lab space, a straightforward implementation of omni-directional and unlimited walking is not generally possible. In this article we review and discuss a set of techniques that use known perceptual limitations and illusions to support seemingly natural walking through a large virtual environment in a confined lab space. The concept behind these techniques is called redirected walking. With redirected walking, users are guided unnoticeably on a physical path that differs from the path the user perceives in the virtual world by manipulating the transformations from real to virtual movements. For example, virtually rotating the view in the HMD to one side with every step causes the user to unknowingly compensate by walking a circular arc in the opposite direction, while having the illusion of walking on a straight trajectory. We describe a number of perceptual illusions that exploit perceptual limitations of motion detectors to manipulate the user’s perception of the speed and direction of his motion. We describe how gains of locomotor speed, rotation, and curvature can gradually alter the physical trajectory without the users observing any discrepancy, and discuss studies that investigated perceptual thresholds for these manipulations. We discuss the potential of self-motion illusions to shift or widen the applicable ranges for gain manipulations and to compensate for over- or underestimations of speed or travel distance in VEs. Finally, we identify a number of key issues for future research on this topic.</abstract>

<abstract>The article presents the results of an experiment where a 7 in. TFT LCD display was exposed to harmonic vibration with acceleration amplitudes up to 200 m/s2 and frequency sweep in the range between 40 Hz and 1.5 kHz. The display was mounted on a shaker in three different positions: landscape, portrait, and face-up. Colorimetric measurements were taken during and after the loading. Euclidian distance in the CIE Lab color space was used as measure of color change due to the loading. The results show that color gamut tends to narrow when increasing the acceleration amplitude. In practical terms however the color change is barely perceptible. In most cases the color changes disappear within 5 h after the stop of the loading. Micro- and macroscopic examination of the LCD was performed to establish an indication of the cause of color change.</abstract>

<number>2</number>
<abstract>Notwithstanding the recent diffusion of the stereoscopic 3D technologies for the development of powerful human computer interaction systems based on augmented reality environment, with the conventional approaches an observer freely moving in front of a 3D display could experience a misperception of the depth and of the shape of virtual objects. Such distortions can cause eye fatigue and stress for entertainment applications, and they can have serious consequences in scientific and medical fields, where a veridical perception of the scene layout is required. We propose a novel technique to obtain augmented reality systems capable to correctly render 3D virtual objects to an observer that changes his/her position in the real world and acts in the virtual scenario. By tracking the positions of the observer’s eyes, the proposed technique generates the correct virtual view points through asymmetric frustums, thus obtaining the correct left and right projections on the screen. The natural perception of the scene layout is assessed through three experimental sessions with several observers.</abstract>

<title>The effect of viewing a laser-scanned display on colour perception and the visual accommodation response.</title>

<volume>29</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>This paper investigated some effects of viewing a laser scanned display (LSD) on visual perception. LSDs potentially provide a high-brightness, monochromatic, image which could have particular effects on the visual system. As a monochromatic image may reduce a potential cue for visual accommodation (chromatic aberration), participants’ accommodation was measured while they viewed an image on either a laser-scanned, or video-projected, display. Furthermore, monochromatic diplays may lead to effects on perception as a result of chromatic adaptation. Colour vision was also assessed before and after using the displays. Increased variability of the level of accommodation was found when using the laser-scanned display, but the magnitude of the effect was mediated by how fast elements of the display were moving. The greatest difference in accommodative variance was between a video display with slow-moving elements (0.016 D) and an equivalent laser-scanned display (0.118 D). Viewing of the laser-scanned display also led to measurable changes in colour perception in some participants. Thus, although further research is required, this paper suggests that viewing a laser-scanned display may have some effect on the accommodation response and on colour perception.</abstract>

<abstract>Holographic polymer dispersed liquid crystals (HPDLC) have been fabricated from four different types of LC at a specific resin composition to optimize the electro-optical performance of the film. Among them, ZLI-3417-100 gave the lowest driving voltage (<2.5 V/μm) and fastest response time (<10 ms) which was interpreted in terms of high dielectric anisotropy (Δɛ) and low viscosity of the LC. However, diffraction efficiency of the film was a bit low due to the relatively small refractive anisotropy (Δn) of the LC giving rise to a small mismatch of refractive index with resin. With regard to the LC content, 40% LC gave the greatest diffraction efficiency, whereas saturation time decreased with increasing content of LC, which emphasizes the viscosity reducing effect of LC.</abstract>

<abstract>Most of the previous studies on spatial S–R compatibility have been limited to the use of hand controls with visual signals on horizontal displays. This study examined the performance of 38 right-handed and right-footed participants in a four choice spatial stimulus–response (S–R) compatibility task with the use of hand and foot controls to respond to visual signals in a vertical plane. The hand and foot dominance of participants was assessed with the Lateral Preference Inventory of Coren (1993). There was a strong spatial S–R compatibility effect in the task revealed by the significant interaction of visual signal position and response key position. The spatial compatibility effect for the above/below dimension was found to be significantly stronger than for the right/left dimension, and no prevalence of right/left over above/below spatial cue was observed in this study. In addition, S–R compatibility produced larger magnitude effect for the top signals compared with bottom ones. As expected, participants responded faster with hands than with feet, and responses from the right foot were faster than those from the left foot for the right-handed/footed participants tested here. The results of this study provide vital information for designing more effective human–machine interfaces with hand and foot controls interacting with vertical plane visual signals.</abstract>

<title>Effect of display resolution and antialiasing on the discrimination of simulated-aircraft orientation.</title>

<number>4-5</number>
<abstract>In Experiment 1, antialiasing was found to improve performance on an orientation-discrimination task, whereas increasing display pixel-count did not. The latter finding was attributed to a decrease in image contrast associated with driving the CRT beyond its effective bandwidth. In Experiment 2, it was found that display resolution is the primary determinant of orientation-discrimination performance. This performance was not significantly improved by increasing antialiasing beyond a minimal level, suggesting that greater image detail can be substituted for antialias filtering. Finally, data obtained from an objective target-size calibration showed that nominal target size often does not accurately reflect the size (and hence distance) of simulated targets.</abstract>

<abstract>A relatively new form of human communication, video-conferencing has become more popular as video technology improves and with increasing demands for real-time communication across greater distances. The full effects of video-conferencing on human communication are still being explored. Video-conferencing is presumed to be a somewhat richer form of communication than email and telephone, but not quite as informative as face-to-face communication. This review explores research into the influence of eye contact on communication and how video-conferencing mediates both verbal and non-verbal interactions. Facilitation of eye contact is a challenge that must be addressed so that video-conferencing can approach the rich interactions of face-to-face communication.</abstract>

<abstract>White organic light-emitting devices consisting of a non-doped ultrathin orange emissive layer (EML) and a doped blue EML were fabricated. The effect of varying electron transporting layers on device performance was studied, while 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline, 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline, tris(8-hydroxy-quinolinato)aluminum and 1,3,5-tris(2-N-phenylbenzimidazolyl)benzene (TPBi) were employed, respectively. The results showed that by comparing four kinds of ETLs, the TPBi device exhibited a current efficiency of 20.9 cd/A at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 10.0%, while stable white emission with Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage coordinates of (0.39, 0.43) were obtained, attributing to efficient charge transportation and exciton confinement.</abstract>

<title>Constrained non-negative matrix factorization for multiline addressing schemes of quick-response liquid powder display.</title>

<abstract>A quick-response liquid powder display (QR-LPD) is a favorable candidate for flexible electronic papers because it can be simply operated by passive-matrix driving. However, the slow image refreshing rate is its major problem. In this study, multiline addressing (MLA) schemes for QR-LPD have been developed for improving the driving efficiency. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with boundary constraints is used for the MLA scheme. A hybrid pulse modulation (HPM) is proposed for further shortening the driving waveform. The experimental results reveal that the MLA using NMF produces a noisy image on QR-LPD. The root cause for this is that NMF is a linear factorization but the electro-optical response of QR-LPD is not a linear curve. Therefore, we have proposed a lossless matrix factorization (LMF) method. The MLA scheme using LMF not only improves the image refreshing rate but also shows images without loss.</abstract>

<abstract>Touchscreens are widely used in electronic products. The purpose of this study is to investigate factors influencing the usability of icons in the LCD touchscreens. In this study, subjects had to answer a questionnaire and rate questions on a five-point Likert scale. Twenty evaluation items were collected from relevant interface design guidelines. Thirty subjects participated in this test, including 10 non-experienced users, 10 click-experienced users (PDA users), and 10 touch-experienced users (LCD touchscreen users). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed with SPSS/ PC as the main statistical test. The PCA results showed that the usability of touch icons was affected by seven factors: touch field, semantics quality, dynamics, hit quality, tactility, color quality, and shape quality. Among these, touch field was rated as being the most important. Finally, the results of correlation analyses indicated that the user experience affected the importance ratings for usability. In particular, the subjects’ ratings exhibited significant differences with regard to the size element (p < 0.05). Further, click-experienced users such as PDA users continued to rate a better performance for touchscreens even if smaller icons were used.</abstract>

<title>Method of controlling external electrode fluorescent lamps for local dimming of liquid crystal displays.</title>
<pages>142-149</pages>

<volume>32</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>This paper proposes a method of controlling external electrode lamps (EEFLs) for local dimming of liquid crystal displays (LCDs). In the proposed method, each EEFL is divided into four partitions using external electrodes formed on the outer surface of the lamp. The luminance is controlled by varying the duration of ac power applied to the center electrode of each partition. The shape of the external circuit for the center electrode is designed to have a reliable on/off operation. Balance circuits connected to the grounded electrodes are used to reduce the luminance difference between the left and right parts of each partition. The proposed method was tested on a 42-in. LCD using an EEFL backlight unit (BLU) after dividing the BLU into 24 blocks. The EEFL BLU could operate reliably up to an ac peak voltage of 1.4 kV, while controlling the luminance of each block independently. When one block at the corner was turned on, and the others were turned off, the luminance ratio was ∼11.1:1 between the block and the nearest one, and ∼9000:1 between the block and the farthest one. These experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is an effective approach for local dimming of LCDs using EEFL BLUs.</abstract>

<title>Effect of single crystalline MgO powder treatment of phosphor surface on discharge property of high-Xe AC plasma display panels.</title>

<number>2</number>
<abstract>This paper presents a method of surface treatment of phosphor using a single crystalline MgO powder, and investigates effect of the surface treatment on discharge property of a plasma display panel (PDP). The discharge gas of the PDP was a 88% Ne–12% Xe gas mixture at a pressure of 400 Torr. For the surface treatment, a single crystalline MgO powder was mixed in methanol, sprayed on the phosphor surface, and annealed at 400 °C. This treatment suppressed glow discharge, which was observed very often in the weak discharges for reset of PDP if the phosphor works as a cathode, and provided a favorable condition for the PDP reset operation. When an experimental PDP fabricated using the surface treatment was driven by the twin reset waveform, the measured time delay for 99.9% cumulative probability of address discharge was 830 ns, which meets the timing requirement for addressing a Full HD (1920 × 1080 resolution) PDP with the 10 sub-field single scan method.</abstract>

With PBD buffer layer several angstroms thickness, the current efficiency increased and the stability of the device was improved. The results suggested that PBD is a promising anode buffer layer for OLEDs. After Compared it with the TiO2 buffer layer, TiO2 and PBD are good candidates for hole-injecting buffer layer. And PBD buffer layer shows better operational durability and life.</abstract>

<abstract>The two-dimensional refractive index distribution of a flexible indium tin oxide film deposited on a PET layer is measured before/after the bend-testing with an alternative technique based on Fresnel equations and the heterodyne interferometry. Their standard deviations are derived and they vary more obviously than the resistance variations measured in the conventional method. Hence the standard deviation of the refractive index can be used as the indicator to justify the durability of a flexible indium tin oxide film. The validity is demonstrated.</abstract>

<abstract>Recently, various wide color gamut displays have been developed. Because of color gamut differences between wide gamut displays and the standard definitions, the color reproduction on such display system is not equal to original images. To overcome this, a color transformation such as gamut mapping algorithm is applied in conventional systems. But this manipulates only the video signal that would reduce the signal dynamic range and produces quantization error of video signal.</abstract>

<abstract>Icons, widely used in computer programs, are part of the Graphical User Interface (GUI). They facilitate computer use regardless of users’ level of expertise. The authors report the results of a study focused on measuring performance of computer users in correctly and quickly associating toolbar icons and the action they represent in GUI. The study aimed to investigate the relationships between the rapidity of icon-function detection by user and user expertise, nature of icon (object or symbol) and context (appropriate, inappropriate, neutral). Findings indicated a scarce variation for different levels of expertise in relation to symbols, but only for icons depicting real-world objects, an overall better performance for objects and no significant response to the context. The discussion suggests future investigations in the field and offers practical considerations for GUI designers.</abstract>

<abstract>Currently, a high-speed driving technology is a rapidly developing creative environment that is looking for ways of driving PDP for high image quality. Herein, a new waveform is proposed for high-speed driving. A proposed driving waveform, which had a log-type scan waveform, was proved by applying to a 4-in. test panel. The results showed that the minimum Vdata voltage of the driving waveform was about 27.0 V at a scan pulse width of 0.8 μs. This result shows that the minimum Vdata voltage decreases by 27.0 V from the conventional driving waveform.</abstract>

<abstract>Despite current advances in multimedia environments, tracing the geometrical structures of graphical images using force feedback remains an important research issue. In this paper, the development and implementation of a multi-modal display system (MMDs) for tracing 2D boundaries in graphic images are discussed. A method is proposed that provides a type of haptic feedback designed to assist a user to trace the contours of objects seen in images. This method is an example of a family of haptic synthesis methods whereby the force field explored by the user is dynamic in the sense that it depends both on movement as well as on the object being haptically represented. The proposed performance-based method provides users with a movement guidance through an active haptic sense rather than common impedance technique. The tracing effectiveness of the proposed method is verified experimentally.</abstract>

<abstract>Color measurement and white balancing for RGB white LEDs was demonstrated by a blue-violet enhanced BDJ photodetector, which can simultaneously determine the centroid wavelength and the radiant power of LEDs from 380 nm to 780 nm. This BDJ photodetector directly gave the chromatic coordinates of a LED that was approximated as a monochromatic stimulus due to its narrow spectrum compared with the CIE color-matching functions. Maximal simulated and experimental errors Δu′v′ to the target white point of the white balanced RGB LEDs was 0.0154 and 0.0214. The BDJ photodetector also performed to be sensitive to the spectrum variation characterized by CCT, and was preferable as a sensor for monitoring the white point.</abstract>

<title>Obtaining high-efficiency red electrophosphorescent OLEDs by changing the thickness of light-emitting layer.</title>

<volume>28</volume>

<abstract>We exhibit highly efficient red electrophosphorescent emission from bis(2-(2′-benzo[4,5-α]thienyl)pyridinato-N, C3′)iridium(acetyl-acetonate) (Btp2Ir(acac)) in organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) which consist of ITO/CuPc/NPB/TPBi:Btp2Ir(acac)/TPBi/Alq/LiF/Al. Here, CuPc is used as hole buffer layer, NPB as hole transport layer, TPBi as host and exciton block layer, Btp2Ir(acac) as dopant, Alq as electron transport layer, and LiF/Al is compound cathode. The high external quantum efficiency of 2.1%, power efficiency of 0.89 lm/W, and current efficiency of 2.43 cd/A, are achieved at the driven current density of 4 mA/cm2 by optimizing the thickness of light-emitting layer (EML) of the device. For the device with the EML thickness of 20 nm, the maximum brightness is high up to 4798 cd/m2 at 600 mA/cm2. The influences of changing EML thickness on the decrease of device efficiency have been discussed in detail. It’s suggested that, triplet–triplet annihilation (T–T annihilation) restrains seriously the enhancement of device efficiency, when the EML thickness of the device is less than 15 nm, and the invalid light-emitting layer, should be mainly responsible for the decline of device efficiency, when the EML thickness is more than 21 nm.</abstract>

<abstract>In this article, we describe a volumetric 3D display system based on the high speed DLP™ (Digital Light Processing) projection engine. Existing two-dimensional (2D) flat screen displays often lead to ambiguity and confusion in high-dimensional data/graphics presentation due to lack of true depth cues. Even with the help of powerful 3D rendering software, three-dimensional (3D) objects displayed on a 2D flat screen may still fail to provide spatial relationship or depth information correctly and effectively. Essentially, 2D displays have to rely upon capability of human brain to piece together a 3D representation from 2D images. Despite the impressive mental capability of human visual system, its visual perception is not reliable if certain depth cues are missing.</abstract>

<abstract>The InGaN-based light-emitting diode (LED) with a clear p-GaN/n-GaN barrier junction is fabricated and investigated. Due to the built-in potential induced by this junction, superior current spreading performance is achieved. In addition, the suppression of current crowding phenomenon yields the reduced parasitic effect. Therefore, under an injection current of 20 mA, improved behaviors including lower turn-on voltage, lower parasitic series resistance, and significantly enhanced electrostatic discharge (ESD) performance are presented.</abstract>

<title>Human factors approach for evaluation and redesign of human-system interfaces of a nuclear power plant simulator.</title>

<abstract>Nuclear power production is a safety-critical process where ultimate execution of process change decisions lie with the operators. Thus it is important to provide the best possible decision support through effective supervisory control operator interfaces. This requires a human factors/ergonomics approach in the modernization of analog instrumentation and control systems of the existing nuclear power plants. In this article, we describe how this approach is being used for modernization of the ANGRA I power plant. Using a cognitive task analysis (CTA) approach, we observed operators working on an advanced control room of a nuclear power plant digital simulator and noted several opportunities for improvement in the human/system interfaces related to the graphics design, alarm systems and procedure integration. A redesigned prototype was constructed as an alternative to the current simulator and hardcopy procedure manuals. The design improves upon the graphical layout of system information and provides better integration of procedures, automation and alarm systems. The design was validated by expert opinion and a scenario-based comparison.</abstract>

<abstract>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of presentation method and presentation rate on reading a dynamic presentation of Chinese text on a single-line display. A novel presentation concept that Chinese word as a presentation unit was examined. Twenty-four subjects completed 12 experimental treatments composed of four presentation methods (i.e., leading format with conventional layout or LC, rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) format with conventional layout or RC, leading format with inter-word spacing or LW, and RSVP format with word or RW) and three presentation rates (120-, 240- and 500-character-per-minute). The results revealed that recall accuracy and satisfaction score for the leading format were better than the RSVP format. Furthermore, the layouts that used words as presentation units were better than the conventional layout in which characters were the presentation units. Subjects’ performance deteriorated when presentation rate was at a high speed of 500 characters per minute, particularly for the RSVP method with conventional layout. The implications of the results on reading a dynamic presentation of Chinese text are discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>Vection-inducing or shaky video images sometimes cause visually induced motion sickness (cybersickness). We determined potential cybersickness intervals and trigger points with biosignals and analyzed video images with the motion vectors. For video images that strongly induced cybersickness, zone intervals with a high correlation coefficient between local and global motion vectors were located at the peaks of trigger points in the time-distribution obtained from 25 subjects. Around the trigger points, the time–frequency structure of global motion vectors included temporal frequencies ranging from 0.3 to 2.5 Hz. This approach will be useful for predicting trigger points in video images from only motion vectors.</abstract>

<title>Egocentric distance perception in large screen immersive displays.</title>
<pages>153-164</pages>
<year>2013</year>
<volume>34</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>Many scientists have demonstrated that compared to the real world egocentric distances in head-mounted display virtual environments are underestimated. However, distance perception in large screen immersive displays has received less attention. We investigate egocentric distance perception in a virtual office room projected using a semi-spherical, a Max Planck Institute CyberMotion Simulator cabin and a flat large screen immersive display. The goal of our research is to systematically investigate distance perception in large screen immersive displays with commonly used technical specifications. We specifically investigate the role of distance to the target, stereoscopic projection and motion parallax on distance perception. We use verbal reports and blind walking as response measures for the real world experiment. Due to the limited space in the three large screen immersive displays we use only verbal reports as the response measure for the experiments in the virtual environment. Our results show an overall underestimation of distance perception in the large screen immersive displays, while verbal estimates of distances are nearly veridical in the real world. We find that even when providing motion parallax and stereoscopic depth cues to the observer in the flat large screen immersive display, participants estimate the distances to be smaller than intended. Although stereo cues in the flat large screen immersive display do increase distance estimates for the nearest distance, the impact of the stereoscopic depth cues is not enough to result in veridical distance perception. Further, we demonstrate that the distance to the target significantly influences the percent error of verbal estimates in both the real and virtual world. The impact of the distance to the target on the distance judgments is the same in the real world and in two of the used large screen displays, namely, the MPI CyberMotion Simulator cabin and the flat displays. However, in the semi-spherical display we observe a significantly different influence of distance to the target on verbal estimates of egocentric distances. Finally, we discuss potential reasons for our results. Based on the findings from our research we give general suggestions that could serve as methods for improving the LSIDs in terms of the accuracy of depth perception and suggest methods to compensate for the underestimation of verbal distance estimates in large screen immersive displays.</abstract>

<number>1</number>
<abstract>This paper presents a method for driving an AC plasma display panel (PDP). This method separates the circuit ground for the sustain pulse generator from the system ground during the sustain period, so it is named the floating single sustain method. The problems observed in previous single sustain methods are solved by separating the ground systems. A drive waveform and circuit for the floating single sustain method are proposed, and a cost-effective method of connecting the drive circuit to the electrodes of a PDP is presented. Experimental results on a 42-in. WVGA single-scan PDP show that the proposed waveform and circuit are well suited for driving the PDP; all problems observed in the previous single sustain method are solved and the power consumption due to the sustain power leakage to the data drive circuit is eliminated.</abstract>

<abstract>Alternate Lightening Display Method (ALDM) for surface-conduction electron-emission display (SED) is proposed to help cutting down the panel fabrication cost. Since the landing position of the emitted electrons on the phosphor plate is mainly determined by the polarity of the device voltage and close to the positive voltage electrode, the same dynamic resolution can be obtained by ALDM with only half surface-conduction electron-emitters (SCEs) compared with the conventional panel. The experiment shows six luminescence lines can be generated with three SCE lines. The emitted electron excursion on the phosphor plate is analyzed with a simplified model, and it is in good agreement with the experiment result.</abstract>

<abstract>LED-based projectors have numerous advantages compared to traditional projectors, but their light output is limited by the limited brightness of the LEDs. With an efficient illumination engine design we can build an LED projector with a moderate light output and with superior properties. In this paper we present a compact LED projector with two ‘Liquid Crystal On Silicon’ panels and four LEDs (R, 2 × G, B). We use two panels instead of the classical three panels and will still have the same performance and moreover a reduced volume and cost. The illumination system consists of a custom made monolithic component (GTLP) that is combining many functions. We have also integrated some methods to increase the brightness of the LEDs by pulsing them. Additional methods, such as using an extra PBS to combine both color channels, are implemented to increase the contrast. After investigating the promising simulation results (119 lm D65 light with very high contrast and uniformity), we built a demonstrator setup. Our demonstrator produces a moderate light output (37.3 lm) on screen with a sufficient contrast ratio and a very good uniformity. In spite of semi color sequential working, the color breakup and crosstalk are negligible. The difference in performance and possible improvements will be discussed in the paper.</abstract>

<abstract>Color quantization is a key step in content-based image retrieval based on color histograms and is critical to the retrieval performance. An important factor related to color quantization is the quantization resolution. It is important to empirically evaluate how resolution levels affect human perceptions of image similarity. A laboratory study was conducted to analyze the effect of different resolution levels on human judgment of image similarity. The results show that the impact of quantization resolutions on perceived image similarity is not linear. In fact, a logarithm relationship fits the data very well. Furthermore, there is a surprising result that the objective measure of colorloss can predict perceived image quite well. The study provides accurate data for content-based image retrieval researchers to decide on the tradeoff between processing speed (which is affected by the choice of resolution level) and perceived image similarity.</abstract>

<title>Analysis of the light-scattering power of patterned dot material printed on the light guide plate in liquid crystal display.</title>

<abstract>The backlight systems for liquid crystal displays often employ a printed dot pattern light-scattering material on one side of the light guide plate (LGP), which provides low cost and mass production-compatible method for fabricating printed screens. The capacity of the printing material to scatter light influences the extraction efficiency from the LGP, making optimization of the scattering properties of the printing material crucial to maximizing the illumination performance of the backlight. In this study the bidirectional scattering distribution functions (BSDFs) of two types of printing materials with different scattering powers were measured and analyzed, and the influence of the scattering on the brightness of the backlight was investigated experimentally and using an optical simulation for an 18.5 in. backlight display system. Investigation results showed that the printing material producing moderate scattering of light results in 6–7% greater average condensed luminance by the brightness enhancement film (BEF) than was found for the printing material producing highly scattering of light, which means that the shape of the angular luminance profile produced by the light-scattering of the printing material can be adjusted in view of increasing the on-axis luminance of edge-lit system.</abstract>

<title>The impact of colour on Website appeal and users' cognitive processes.</title>

<abstract>One of the challenges today in human–computer interaction is to design systems that are not only usable but also appealing to users. In order to contribute to meet this challenge, our general objective in the present study was to enhance current understanding of the perceptual features that favour users’ interactions with Websites. This is a particularly important issue, as users’ first impressions when they land on a site determine whether or not they stay on it. We conducted two experimental studies, focusing on one specific perceptual feature: Website colour. The first study investigated designers’ and users’ preferred colours for a Web homepage. Although researchers generally flag up differences between designers and users, we found that the latter also had several favourite colours in common. On the basis of these initial results, three colours were selected for a second study exploring colour in relation to an entire Website. The main originality of this second study lays in the fact that we used both subjective and objective measurements to gauge the impact of colour, analyzing not only users’ judgments but also their Website navigation and the items of information they memorized. Results of this second study showed that colours were a determining factor in the way that users interacted with the Website. Their influence was also observed afterwards, when users were asked to exploit the information they had gleaned from the Website. As such, these findings will have a practical value for Website designers.</abstract>

<abstract>Inkjet-printed greenish color filter layer for the application of active-matrix TFT-LCD had been significantly fabricated by the modified inkjet printing technology. The greenish ink with nano-particle pigments was injected in the stripe-type pattern with 90 μm in width and 250 μm in length by pre-designed inkjet head and driving system, and only green color was tested. The height of transparent rib wall, prepared by lithographic processes, on black matrix is 5.0 μm. The chromatic coordinates of color filter with greenish subpixel patterns in CIE 1931 standard diagram can achieve in the region of x=0.3095±0.04, y=0.5912±0.04, brightness of Y=58.887 for 50 droplets and x=0.3103±0.04, y=0.5784±0.04, brightness of Y=60.328 for 41 droplets. The structural surface morphologies of the greenish subpixel patterns remain homogenous, smooth and flatten.</abstract>

<abstract>Multi-primary displays have the advantage of large color gamut. The relative primary luminances of a conventional three-primary display are uniquely determined by its white point. There are N−3 degrees of freedom for choosing the relative primary luminances of an N-primary display with a given white point. This paper presents the methods designing the relative primary luminances of four-primary displays. A four-primary LED display is taken as an example for showing the methods. The maximum display luminance and color gamut are, respectively, taken as an additional requirement for determining the relative primary luminances of the display. The requirement of the maximum display luminance is taken for a set of available primary luminances. The gamut volume in CIELAB color space is defined for maximizing the display gamut. In practice, the design of the relative primary luminances may be a compromised result of the two additional requirements.</abstract>

<title>Vergence eye movements signifying 3D depth perception from 2D movies.</title>
<pages>91-97</pages>

<volume>33</volume>
<journal>Displays</journal>

<abstract>A sensation of depth can arise from two-dimensional (2D) movies without any stereoscopic depth cue. Depth perception in three-dimensional (3D) space depends on the stability of stereoscopic gaze by vergence – coordinated movement of the two eyes in opposite directions – compensating the misalignment of the retinal images from the two eyes (i.e. binocular disparity) [1]. On the other hand, the oculomotor mechanisms that stabilize stereoscopic gaze and depth perception in 2D movie space remain unclear [2]. Here, we propose a hypothesis that vergence eye movements signifying 3D depth perception persist during prolonged 2D movie presentation without binocular disparity cues. By measuring eye positions while the subject viewed moving random-dot video stimuli, we show that sustained vergence is induced during 30-s exposure to radially expanding 2D optic flow. Moreover, a 2D video movie showing a passenger’s view of a roller coaster induces continuously changing vergence. In the absence of binocular disparity cues, the pictorial depth information within a 5° × 5° gaze window and optic flow in the movie simultaneously and independently influence vergence. The pictorial gaze-area depth information affects vergence mainly in the virtual far space, whereas optic flow robustly affects vergence irrespective of the nearness. These findings demonstrate that vergence serves as a reliable marker signifying 3D depth perception from 2D movies, imposing critical constraints on creation of an effective and safe virtual reality.</abstract>

<abstract>Microcavity light emitting diodes based on materials with broad emission spectrum, such as tris (8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3), typically exhibit a significant blue shift of the emission wavelength with increasing viewing angle. In this work, we investigate the influence of the organic layer thickness on the angular dependence of the emission spectrum in low Q-factor microcavity OLEDs. We demonstrate that for different organic layer thicknesses qualitatively different emission wavelength dependences on the viewing angle can be obtained in microcavity devices consisting of two organic layers, N,N′-di(naphthalene-1-yl)-N,N′-diphenylbenzidine (NPB) as a hole transport layer and Alq3 as emitting layer. The devices with different organic layer thickness were characterized by electroluminescence, photoluminescence, reflectance, and transmission measurements and results compared with the model.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper, we present a new approach to aligning liquid crystal (LC) molecules on thin SiO2 films. The SiO2 film is obliquely deposited using electron beam evaporation. The effectiveness of the oblique SiO2 films is determined through measurements of optical and electrical properties. The columnar topography of the SiO2 alignment layer is observed using atomic force microscope (AFM) images. Using an oblique deposition angle of 35°, the deposited SiO2 films reach optimal surface morphology regarding transmittance (92.4%) and roughness (1.643 nm). With this new optimal film, LCD applications show improvements in response time and contrast ratio when compared to LCD applications, which use the typical 90° deposition method. The improvements are about 135 and 40%, respectively.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents a distributed circuit model of the cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) in the back-light units (BLUs) of liquid crystal displays (LCDs). This model consists of nonlinear resistors and parasitic circuit elements, and it can be used to simulate CCFL BLUs for various input waveforms using standard circuit simulators. The nonlinear resistors were modeled after the measured DC current–voltage characteristics of CCFLs. The coupling effects between CCFLs and between CCFL and the BLU frame were represented using the parasitic capacitances and inductances. For both pulsed and sinusoidal inputs, the voltage error between electrical simulation and measurement was ⩽1.3% and the current error was ⩽5.8%. These results demonstrate that the circuit model can be used to simulate the electrical behavior of CCFLs in LCD BLU accurately.</abstract>

<title>Feasibility study of edge-lit backlight of dual-panel display by a simple configuration model.</title>

<abstract>This study proposes a feasibility study of edge-lit backlight of dual-panel display by a simple configuration model based on a luminous flux flow perspective. The model is applied to investigate the interaction between the backlight configuration parameters, including the dot density of the light guide and the reflectances of the upper and lower films and the lower reflector sheet, respectively. The results show that the luminance difference between the main panel and the sub-panel is determined primarily by the dot reflectance in the region of the light guide common to the two panels and by the reflectances of the upper and lower films, respectively. To maximize the main panel luminance, higher reflectance values should be assigned to the dots in the non-common region of the light guide and to the lower reflector sheet. The dot reflectance in the non-common region is highly sensitive to changes in the value of the dot density in the common region. Finally, the dot density in the common region and the dot density in the non-common region are related by a quadratic function in which the rate of increase of the dot density in the common region is greater than that in the non-common region.</abstract>

<abstract>Two types of display defects were found at special positions near the pixel indium tin oxide (ITO) edge in the multi-domain vertical alignment (MVA) mode liquid crystal display (LCD). Through simulated and experimental results, the formation mechanisms of these two types of display defects, the detailed configurations of liquid crystal (LC) orientations at the display defect regions and the principle to suppress the defect dark line were analyzed and discussed. It was further found that the occurrence of the dark line was related to the positioning accuracy of substrate assembly. The reason of the dark line occurrence related with the positioning accuracy and the manufacturing margin were provided here.</abstract>

<title>Identification of Distinguishing Motifs.</title>

<number>3</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract Motif identification for DNA sequences has many important applications in biological studies, including diagnostic probe design, locating binding sites and regulatory signals, and potential drug target identification. There are two versions—the Single Group and Two Groups. Here, the occurrences of the motif in the given sequences have errors. Currently, most of existing programs can only handle the case of single group. However, most of the programs do not allow indels (insertions and deletions) in the occurrences of the motif. In this paper, the authors propose a randomized algorithm for the one group problem that can handle indels in the occurrences of the motif. Finally, an algorithm for the two groups’ problem is given along with extensive simulations evaluating algorithms. </abstract>

<title>Wave-SOM: A Novel Wavelet-Based Clustering Algorithm for Analysis of Gene Expression Patterns.</title>
<pages>50-73</pages>
<year>2010</year>
<volume>1</volume>
<journal>IJKDB</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract In this paper, the authors present a wavelet-based algorithm (Wave-SOM) to help visualize and cluster oscillatory time-series data in two-dimensional gene expression micro-arrays. Using various wavelet transformations, raw data are first de-noised by decomposing the time-series into low and high frequency wavelet coefficients. Following thresholding, the coefficients are fed as an input vector into a two-dimensional Self-Organizing-Map clustering algorithm. Transformed data are then clustered by minimizing the Euclidean (L2) distance between their corresponding fluctuation patterns. A multi-resolution analysis by Wave-SOM of expression data from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, exposed to oxidative stress and glucose-limited growth, identified 29 genes with correlated expression patterns that were mapped into 5 different nodes. The ordered clustering of yeast genes by Wave-SOM illustrates that the same set of genes (encoding ribosomal proteins) can be regulated by two different environmental stresses, oxidative stress and starvation. The algorithm provides heuristic information regarding the similarity of different genes. Using previously studied expression patterns of yeast cell-cycle and functional genes as test data sets, the authors’ algorithm outperformed five other competing programs. </abstract>

<title>Towards a Mixed Approach to Extract Biomedical Terms from Text Corpus.</title>

<year>2014</year>
<volume>4</volume>
<journal>IJKDB</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract The objective of this paper is to present a methodology to extract and rank automatically biomedical terms from free text. The authors present new extraction methods taking into account linguistic patterns specialized for the biomedical domain, statistic term extraction measures such as C-value and statistic keyword extraction measures such as Okapi BM25, and TFIDF. These measures are combined in order to improve the extraction process and the authors investigate which combinations are the more relevant associated to different contexts. Experimental results show that an appropriate harmonic mean of C-value associated to keyword extraction measures offers better precision, both for single-word and multi-words term extraction. Experiments describe the extraction of English and French biomedical terms from a corpus of laboratory tests available online. The results are validated by using UMLS (in English) and only MeSH (in French) as reference dictionary. </abstract>

<title>Medical Survival Analysis Through Transduction of Semi-Supervised Regression Targets.</title>
<pages>52-65</pages>
<year>2011</year>
<volume>2</volume>
<journal>IJKDB</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract A crucial challenge in predictive modeling for survival analysis applications such as medical prognosis is the accounting of censored observations in the data. While these time-to-event predictions inherently represent a regression problem, traditional regression approaches are challenged by the censored characteristics of the data. In such problems the true target times of a majority of instances are unknown; what is known is a censored target representing some indeterminate time before the true target time. While censored samples can be considered as semi-supervised targets, the current limited efforts in semi-supervised regression do not take into account the partial nature of unsupervised information; samples are treated as either fully labeled or unlabelled. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised learning approach where the true target times are approximated from the censored times through transduction. The method can be employed to transform traditional regression methods for survival analysis, or can be employed to enhance existing state-of-the-art survival analysis methods for improved predictive performance. The proposed approach represents one of the first applications of semi-supervised regression to survival analysis and yields a significant improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art in prostate and breast cancer prognosis applications. </abstract>

<title>Coupled Matrix Factorization with Sparse Factors to Identify Potential Biomarkers in Metabolomics.</title>
<pages>22-43</pages>
<year>2012</year>
<volume>3</volume>
<journal>IJKDB</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract Metabolomics focuses on the detection of chemical substances in biological fluids such as urine and blood using a number of analytical techniques including Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Among the major challenges in analysis of metabolomics data are (i) joint analysis of data from multiple platforms, and (ii) capturing easily interpretable underlying patterns, which could be further utilized for biomarker discovery. In order to address these challenges, the authors formulate joint analysis of data from multiple platforms as a coupled matrix factorization problem with sparsity penalties on the factor matrices. They developed an all-at-once optimization algorithm, called CMF-SPOPT (Coupled Matrix Factorization with SParse OPTimization), which is a gradient-based optimization approach solving for all factor matrices simultaneously. Using numerical experiments on simulated data, the authors demonstrate that CMF-SPOPT can capture the underlying sparse patterns in data. Furthermore, on a real data set of blood samples collected from a group of rats, the authors use the proposed approach to jointly analyze metabolomics data sets and identify potential biomarkers for apple intake. Advantages and limitations of the proposed approach are also discussed using illustrative examples on metabolomics data sets. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract Genetic factors play a major role in the etiology of many human diseases. Genome-wide experimental methods produce an increasing number of genes associated with such diseases. This article introduces data sources, bioinformatics tools, and computational methods for prioritizing disease candidate genes and identifying disease pathways. The main strategy is to examine the similarity among the candidate genes and known disease genes at the functional level. The authors review different similarity measures and prevailing methods for integrating results from different functional aspects. The authors hope this article will help advocate many useful resources that the researchers can use to investigate diseases of their interest. </abstract>

<title>Mining Frequent Boolean Expressions: Application to Gene Expression and Regulatory Modeling.</title>
<pages>68-96</pages>
<year>2010</year>
<volume>1</volume>
<journal>IJKDB</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract Regulatory network analysis and other bioinformatics tasks require the ability to induce and represent arbitrary boolean expressions from data sources. In this paper, the authors introduce a novel framework called BLOSOM for mining (frequent) boolean expressions over binary-valued datasets. Boolean expressions can be grouped into four categories: pure conjunctions, pure disjunctions, conjunction of disjunctions, and disjunction of conjunctions. The authors’ main focus is on mining the simplest expressions (the minimal generators), but also to propose closure operators that yield closed (or unique maximal) boolean expressions. BLOSOM efficiently mines frequent boolean expressions by utilizing a number of methodical pruning techniques. Experiments showcase the behavior of BLOSOM for different input settings and parameter thresholds. Application studies on gene expression and gene regulation patterns showcase the effectiveness of this approach. </abstract>

<title>Healthcare Data Mining: Predicting Hospital Length of Stay (PHLOS).</title>
<pages>44-66</pages>
<year>2012</year>
<volume>3</volume>
<journal>IJKDB</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract A model to predict the Length of Stay (LOS) for hospitalized patients can be an effective tool for measuring the consumption of hospital resources. Such a model will enable early interventions to prevent complications and prolonged LOS and also enable more efficient utilization of manpower and facilities in hospitals. In this paper, the authors propose an approach for Predicting Hospital Length of Stay (PHLOS) using a multi-tiered data mining approach. In their aproach, the authors form training sets, using groups of similar claims identified by k-means clustering and perfom classification using ten different classifiers. The authors provide a combined measure of performance to statistically evaluate and rank the classifiers for different levels of clustering. They consistently found that using clustering as a precursor to form the training set gives better prediction results as compared to non-clustering based training sets. The authors have also found the accuracies to be consistently higher than some reported in the current literature for predicting individual patient LOS. Binning the LOS to three groups of short, medium and long stays, their method identifies patients who need aggressive or moderate early interventions to prevent prolonged stays. The classification techniques used in this study are interpretable, enabling them to examine the details of the classification rules learned from the data. As a result, this study provides insight into the underlying factors that influence hospital length of stay. They also examine the authors’ prediction results for three randomly selected conditions with domain expert insights. </abstract>

<volume>2</volume>

<number>4</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) include one of the largest and most important families of multifunctional proteins known to molecular biology. They play a key role in cell signaling networks that regulate many physiological processes, such as vision, smell, taste, neurotransmission, secretion, immune responses, metabolism, and cell growth. These proteins are thus very important for understanding human physiology and they are involved in several diseases. Therefore, many efforts in pharmaceutical research are to understand their structures and functions, which is not an easy task, because although thousands GPCR sequences are known, many of them remain orphans. To remedy this, many methods have been developed using methods such as statistics, machine learning algorithms, and bio-inspired approaches. In this article, the authors review the approaches used to develop algorithms for classification GPCRs by trying to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these different approaches and providing a comparison of their performances. </abstract>

<title>Finding Minimum Reaction Cuts of Metabolic Networks Under a Boolean Model Using Integer Programming and Feedback Vertex Sets.</title>

<abstract>Top Abstract In this paper, the authors consider the problem of, given a metabolic network, a set of source compounds and a set of target compounds, finding a minimum size reaction cut, where a Boolean model is used as a model of metabolic networks. The problem has potential applications to measurement of structural robustness of metabolic networks and detection of drug targets. They develop an integer programming-based method for this optimization problem. In order to cope with cycles and reversible reactions, they further develop a novel integer programming (IP) formalization method using a feedback vertex set (FVS). When applied to an E. coli metabolic network consisting of Glycolysis/Glyconeogenesis, Citrate cycle and Pentose phosphate pathway obtained from KEGG database, the FVS-based method can find an optimal set of reactions to be inactivated much faster than a naive IP-based method and several times faster than a flux balance-based method. The authors also confirm that our proposed method works even for large networks and discuss the biological meaning of our results. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract Protein-protein interactions play various essential roles in cellular systems. Many methods have been developed for inference of protein-protein interactions from protein sequence data. In this paper, the authors focus on methods based on domain-domain interactions, where a domain is defined as a region within a protein that either performs a specific function or constitutes a stable structural unit. In these methods, the probabilities of domain-domain interactions are inferred from known protein-protein interaction data and protein domain data, and then prediction of interactions is performed based on these probabilities and contents of domains of given proteins. This paper overviews several fundamental methods, which include association method, expectation maximization-based method, support vector machine-based method, linear programming-based method, and conditional random field-based method. This paper also reviews a simple evolutionary model of protein domains, which yields a scale-free distribution of protein domains. By combining with a domain-based protein interaction model, a scale-free distribution of protein-protein interaction networks is also derived. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract The accumulation of high-throughput genomic and proteomic data allows for reconstruction of large and complex metabolic networks. To analyze accumulated data and reconstructed networks, it is critical to identify network patterns and evolutionary relations between metabolic networks; finding similar networks is computationally challenging. Based on gene duplication and function sharing in biological networks, a network alignment problem is formulated that asks the optimal vertex-to-vertex mapping allowing path contraction, different types of vertex deletion, and vertex insertions. This paper presents fixed parameter tractable combinatorial optimization algorithms, which take into account the similarity of both the enzymes’ functions arbitrary network topologies. Results are evaluated by the randomized P-Value computation. The authors perform pairwise alignments of all pathways for four organisms and find a set of statistically significant pathway similarities. The network alignment is used to identify pathway holes that are the result of inconsistencies and missing enzymes. The authors propose a framework of filling pathway holes by including database searches for missing enzymes and proteins with the matching prosites and further finding potential candidates with high sequence similarity. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract A computational mutagenesis is detailed whereby each single residue substitution in a protein chain of primary sequence length N is represented as a sparse N-dimensional feature vector, whose M << N nonzero components locally quantify environmental perturbations occurring at the mutated position and its neighbors in the protein structure. The methodology makes use of both the Delaunay tessellation algorithm for representing protein structures, as well as a four-body, knowledge based, statistical contact potential. Feature vectors for each subset of mutants due to all possible residue substitutions at a particular position cohabit the same M-dimensional subspace, where the value of M and the identities of the M nonzero components are similarly position dependent. The approach is used to characterize a large experimental dataset of single residue substitutions in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme, each categorized as either unaffected or affected based on the measured level of mutant activity relative to that of the native protein. Performance of a single classifier trained with the collective set of mutants in N-space is compared to that of an ensemble of position-specific classifiers trained using disjoint mutant subsets residing in significantly smaller subspaces. Results suggest that significant improvements can be achieved through subspace modeling. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has consistently been shown to be useful for optimization of drug therapy. For the first time, a method has been developed for the text analysis of TDM in SPCs in that a catalogue SPC-ContentTDM (SPCCTDM) provides a codification of the content of TDM in SPCs. It consists of six structure-related items (dose, adverse drug reactions, drug interactions, overdose, pregnancy/breast feeding, and pharmacokinetics) according to implicit or explicit references to TDM in paragraphs of the SPC, and four theory-guided items according to the information about ranges of plasma concentrations and a recommendation of TDM in the SPC. The catalogue is regarded as valid for the text analysis of SPCs with respect to TDM. It can be used in the comparison of SPCs, in the comparison with medico-scientific evidence and for the estimation of the perception of TDM in SPCs by the reader. Regarding the approach as a model of text mining, it may be extended for evaluation of other aspects reported in SPCs. </abstract>

<title>Hierarchical Density-Based Clustering of White Matter Tracts in the Human Brain.</title>

<abstract>Top Abstract Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) provides a promising way of estimating the neural fiber pathways in the human brain non-invasively via white matter tractography. However, it is difficult to analyze the vast number of resulting tracts quantitatively. Automatic tract clustering would be useful for the neuroscience community, as it can contribute to accurate neurosurgical planning, tract-based analysis, or white matter atlas creation. In this paper, the authors propose a new framework for automatic white matter tract clustering using a hierarchical density-based approach. A novel fiber similarity measure based on dynamic time warping allows for an effective and efficient evaluation of fiber similarity. A lower bounding technique is used to further speed up the computation. Then the algorithm OPTICS is applied, to sort the data into a reachability plot, visualizing the clustering structure of the data. Interactive and automatic clustering algorithms are finally introduced to obtain the clusters. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our fiber similarity measure and show that the hierarchical density-based clustering method can group these tracts into meaningful bundles on multiple scales as well as eliminating noisy fibers. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract In the post-genomic era, biological databases are growing at a tremendous rate. Despite rapid accumulation of biological information, functions and other biological properties of many putative gene products of various organisms remain either unknown or obscure. This paper examines how strategic integration of large biological databases and combinations of various biological information helps address some of the fundamental questions on protein structure, function and interactions. New developments in function recognition by remote homology detection and strategic use of sequence databases aid recognition of functions of newly discovered proteins. Knowledge of 3-D structures and combined use of sequences and 3-D structures of homologous protein domains expands the ability of remote homology detection enormously. The authors also demonstrate how combined consideration of functions of individual domains of multi-domain proteins helps in recognizing gross biological attributes. This paper also discusses a few cases of combining disparate biological datasets or combination of disparate biological information in obtaining new insights about protein-protein interactions across a host and a pathogen. Finally, the authors discuss how combinations of low resolution structural data, obtained using cryoEM studies, of gigantic multi-component assemblies, and atomic level 3-D structures of the components is effective in inferring finer features in the assembly. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract An important task of aging research is to find genes that regulate lifespan. Wet-lab identification of aging genes is tedious and labor-intensive activity. Developing an algorithm to predict aging genes will be greatly helpful. In this paper, we systematically analyzed topological features of proteins encoded by Drosophila melanogaster aging genes versus those encoded by non-aging genes in protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and found that aging genes are characterized by several network topological features such as higher in degrees. And aging genes tend to be enriched in certain functions were also found. Based on these features, an algorithm was developed to detect aging genes genome wide. With a posterior probability score describing possible involvement in aging no less than 1, 1014 novel aging genes were predicted by decision trees. Evidence supporting our prediction can be found. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract One of the main causes of death the world over is the family of cardiovascular diseases, of which coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major type. Angiography is the principal diagnostic modality for the stenosis of heart arteries; however, it leads to high complications and costs. The present study conducted data-mining algorithms on the Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset, so as to investigate rule based and feature based classifiers and their comparison, and the reason for the effectiveness of a preprocessing algorithm on a dataset. Misclassification of diseased patients has more side effects than that of healthy ones. To this end, this paper employs 10-fold cross-validation on cost-sensitive algorithms along with base classifiers of Naïve Bayes, Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and C4.5 and the results show that the SMO algorithm yielded very high sensitivity (97.22%) and accuracy (92.09%) rates. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract In this paper, the authors identify the strategies that resistant subpopulations of cancer cells undertake to overcome the effect of the anticancer drug Topotecan. For the analyses of cell lineage data encoded from timelapse microscopy, data mining tools are chosen that generate interpretable models of the data, addressing their statistical significance. By interpreting the short-term and long-term cytotoxic effect of Topotecan through these data models, the authors reveal the strategies that resistant subpopulations of cells undertake to maximize their clonal expansion potential. In this context, this paper identifies a pattern of cell death independent of cytotoxic effect. Finally, it is observed that cells exposed to Topotecan have higher movement over time, indicating a putative relationship between cytotoxic effect and cell motility. </abstract>

<title>Efficient Mining Frequent Closed Discriminative Biclusters by Sample-Growth: The FDCluster Approach.</title>
<pages>69-88</pages>
<year>2010</year>
<volume>1</volume>
<journal>IJKDB</journal>
<number>4</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract DNA microarray technology has generated a large number of gene expression data. Biclustering is a methodology allowing for condition set and gene set points clustering simultaneously. It finds clusters of genes possessing similar characteristics together with biological conditions creating these similarities. Almost all the current biclustering algorithms find bicluster in one microarray dataset. In order to reduce the noise influence and find more biological biclusters, the authors propose the FDCluster algorithm in order to mine frequent closed discriminative bicluster in multiple microarray datasets. FDCluster uses Apriori property and several novel techniques for pruning to mine biclusters efficiently. To increase the space usage, FDCluster also utilizes several techniques to generate frequent closed bicluster without candidate maintenance in memory. The experimental results show that FDCluster is more effective than traditional methods in either single micorarray dataset or multiple microarray datasets. This paper tests the biological significance using GO to show the proposed method is able to produce biologically relevant biclusters. </abstract>

<title>Bioinformatics Methods for Studying MicroRNA and ARE-Mediated Regulation of Post-Transcriptional Gene Expression.</title>

<volume>1</volume>

<abstract>Top Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short single-stranded RNA molecules with 21-22 nucleotides known to regulate post-transcriptional expression of protein-coding genes involved in most of the cellular processes. Prediction of miRNA targets is a challenging bioinformatics problem. AU-rich elements (AREs) are regulatory RNA motifs found in the 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, and they play dominant roles in the regulated decay of short-lived human mRNAs via specific interactions with proteins. In this paper, the authors review several miRNA target prediction tools and data sources, as well as computational methods used for the prediction of AREs. The authors discuss the connection between miRNA and ARE-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation. Finally, a data mining method for identifying the co-occurrences of miRNA target sites in ARE containing genes is presented. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract Whenever new sequences of DNA or proteins have been decoded it is almost compulsory to look at similar sequences and papers describing those sequences in order to both collect relevant information concerning the function and activity of the new sequences and/or know what is known already about similar sequences. In current web sites and data bases of sequences there are, usually, a set of curated paper references linked to each sequence. Those links are a good starting point to look for relevant information related to a set of sequences. One way to implement such approach is to do a blast with the new decoded sequences, and collect similar sequences. Then one looks at the papers linked with the similar sequences. Most often the number of retrieved papers is small and one has to search large data bases for relevant papers. This paper proposes a process of generating a classifier based on the initially set of relevant papers. First, the authors collect similar sequences using an alignment algorithm like Blast. Then, the authors use the enlarges set of papers to construct a classifier. Finally a classifier is used to automatically enlarge the set of relevant papers by searching the MEDLINE using the automatically constructed classifier. </abstract>

<title>Classifier Ensemble Methods for Diagnosing COPD from Volatile Organic Compounds in Exhaled Air.</title>

<abstract>Top Abstract The diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is based on symptoms, clinical examination, exposure to risk factors (smoking and certain occupational dusts) and confirming lung airflow obstruction (on spirometry). However, most people with COPD remain undiagnosed and controversies regarding spirometry persist. Developing accurate and reliable automated tests for the early diagnosis of COPD would aid successful management. We evaluated the diagnostic potential of a non-invasive test of chemical analysis (volatile organic compounds - VOCs) from exhaled breath. We applied 26 individual classifier methods and 30 state-of-the-art classifier ensemble methods to a large VOC data set from 109 patients with COPD and 63 healthy controls of similar age; we evaluated the classification error, the F measure and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The results show that classifying the VOCs leads to substantial gain over chance but of varying accuracy. We found that Rotation Forest ensemble (AUC 0.825) had the highest accuracy for COPD classification from exhaled VOCs. </abstract>

<title>Improved Feature Selection by Incorporating Gene Similarity into the LASSO.</title>

<volume>3</volume>
<journal>IJKDB</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract Personalized medicine is customizing treatments to a patient’s genetic profile and has the potential to revolutionize medical practice. An important process used in personalized medicine is gene expression profiling. Analyzing gene expression profiles is difficult, because there are usually few patients and thousands of genes, leading to the curse of dimensionality. To combat this problem, researchers suggest using prior knowledge to enhance feature selection for supervised learning algorithms. The authors propose an enhancement to the LASSO, a shrinkage and selection technique that induces parameter sparsity by penalizing a model’s objective function. Their enhancement gives preference to the selection of genes that are involved in similar biological processes. The authors’ modified LASSO selects similar genes by penalizing interaction terms between genes. They devise a coordinate descent algorithm to minimize the corresponding objective function. To evaluate their method, the authors created simulation data where they compared their model to the standard LASSO model and an interaction LASSO model. The authors’ model outperformed both the standard and interaction LASSO models in terms of detecting important genes and gene interactions for a reasonable number of training samples. They also demonstrated the performance of their method on a real gene expression data set from lung cancer cell lines. </abstract>

<number>3</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract Tandem repeats in DNA sequences are extremely relevant in biological phenomena and diagnostic tools. Computational programs that discover these tandem repeats generate a huge volume of data, which is often difficult to decipher without further organization. In this paper, the authors describe a new method for post-processing tandem repeats through clustering and classification. Their work presents multiple ways of expressing tandem repeats using the n-gram model with different clustering distance measures. Analysis of the clusters for the tandem repeats in the human genome shows that the method yields a well-defined grouping in which similarity among repeats is apparent. The authors’ new, alignment-free method facilitates the analysis of the myriad of tandem repeats that occur in the human genome and they believe that this work will lead to new discoveries on the roles, origins, and significance of tandem repeats. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract Searching for repeated features characterizing biological data is fundamental in computational biology. When biological networks are under analysis, the presence of repeated modules across the same network (or several distinct ones) is shown to be very relevant. Indeed, several studies prove that biological networks can be often understood in terms of coalitions of basic repeated building blocks, often referred to as network motifs.This work provides a review of the main techniques proposed for motif extraction from biological networks. In particular, main intrinsic difficulties related to the problem are pointed out, along with solutions proposed in the literature to overcome them. Open challenges and directions for future research are finally discussed. </abstract>

<title>Evidence-Based Combination of Weighted Classifiers Approach for Epileptic Seizure Detection using EEG Signals.</title>

<volume>3</volume>
<journal>IJKDB</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract Different brain states and conditions can be captured by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. EEG-based epileptic seizure detection techniques often reduce these signals into sets of discriminant features. In this work, an evidence theory-based approach for epileptic detection, using several classifiers, is proposed. Within the framework of the evidence theory, each of these classifiers is considered a source of information and given a certain weight based on both its overall classification accuracy as well as its precision rate for the respective brain state. These sources are fused using the Dempster’s rule of combination. Experimental work is done where five time domain features are obtained from EEG signals and used by a set classifiers, namely, Bayesian, K-nearest neighbor, neural network, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machine classifiers. Higher classification accuracy of 89.5% is achieved, compared to 75.07% and 87.71% accuracy obtained from the worst and best used classifiers. </abstract>

Biological and medical data are increasing at very rapid rates, which in many cases outpace even Moore's law. This is the result of recent technological development, as well as the exploratory attitude of human beings, that prompts scientists to answer more questions by conducting more experiments. Representative examples are the advances in sequencing and medical imaging technologies. Challenges posed by this data deluge, and the emerging opportunities of their efficient management and analysis are also part of the discussion. The major emphasis is given to the most common biological and medical data mining applications. </abstract>

<number>2</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract Clustering of gene expression data is a standard exploratory technique used to identify closely related genes. Many other sources of data are also likely to be of great assistance in the analysis of gene expression data. This data provides a mean to begin elucidating the large-scale modular organization of the cell. The authors consider the challenging task of developing exploratory analytical techniques to deal with multiple complete and incomplete information sources. The Multi-Source Clustering (MSC) algorithm developed performs clustering with multiple, but complete, sources of data. To deal with incomplete data sources, the authors adopted the MPCK-means clustering algorithms to perform exploratory analysis on one complete source and other potentially incomplete sources provided in the form of constraints. This paper presents a new clustering algorithm MSC to perform exploratory analysis using two or more diverse but complete data sources, studies the effectiveness of constraints sets and robustness of the constrained clustering algorithm using multiple sources of incomplete biological data, and incorporates such incomplete data into constrained clustering algorithm in form of constraints sets. </abstract>

<title>Early Deterioration Warning for Hospitalized Patients by Mining Clinical Data.</title>

<volume>2</volume>
<journal>IJKDB</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract Data mining on medical data has great potential to improve the treatment quality of hospitals and increase the survival rate of patients. Every year, 4-17% of patients undergo cardiopulmonary or respiratory arrest while in hospitals. Clinical study has found early detection and intervention to be essential for preventing clinical deterioration in patients at general hospital units. This paper proposes an early warning system (EWS) designed to identify the signs of clinical deterioration and provide early warning for serious clinical events. The EWS is designed to provide reliable early alarms for patients at the general hospital wards (GHWs). The main task of EWS is a challenging classification problem on high-dimensional stream data with irregular, multi-scale data gaps, measurement errors, outliers, and class imbalance. This paper proposes a novel data mining framework for analyzing such medical data streams. The authors assess the feasibility of the proposed EWS approach through retrospective study that includes data from 41,503 visits at a major hospital. Finally, the system is applied in a clinical trial at a major hospital and obtains promising results. This project is an example of multidisciplinary cyber-physical systems involving researchers in clinical science, data mining, and nursing staff. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract The reconstruction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks from high-throughput experimental data is one of the most challenging problems in bioinformatics. These biological networks have specific topologies defined by the functional and evolutionary relationships between the proteins and the physical limitations imposed on proteins interacting in the three-dimensional space. In this paper, the authors propose a novel approach for the identification of potential protein-protein interactions based on the integration of known PPI network topology and transcriptomic data. The proposed method, Function Restricted Value Neighborhood (FRV-N), was used to reconstruct PPI networks using an experimental data set consisting of 170 yeast microarray profiles. The results of this analysis demonstrate that incorporating knowledge of interactome topology improves the ability of transcriptome analysis to reconstruct interaction networks with a high degree of biological relevance. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract Cerebral Palsy is defined as a group of permanent disorders in the development of movement and posture. The motor disorders in cerebral palsy are associated with deficits of perception, cognition, communication, and behaviour, which can affect autonomy and independence. The interface between the user and an intelligent wheelchair can be done with several input devices such as joysticks, microphones, and brain computer interfaces (BCI). BCI enables interaction between users and hardware systems through the recognition of brainwave activity. The current BCI systems have very low accuracy on the recognition of facial expressions and thoughts, making it difficult to use these devices to enable safe and robust commands of complex devices like an Intelligent Wheelchair. This paper presents an approach to expand the use of a brain computer interface for driving an intelligent wheelchair by patients suffering from cerebral palsy. The ability with the joystick, head movements, and voice inputs were tested, and the best possibility for driving the wheelchair is given to a specific user. Experiments were performed using 30 individuals suffering from IV and V degrees of cerebral palsy on the Gross Motor Function (GMF) measure. The results show that the pre-processing and variable selection methods are effective to improve the results of a commercial BCI product by 57%. With the developed system, it is also possible for users to perform a circuit in a simulated environment using just facial expressions and thoughts. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract The genomes of many human pathogens have been sequenced but the protein-protein interactions across a pathogen and human are still poorly understood. The authors apply a simple homology-based method to predict protein-protein interactions between human host and two mycobacterial organisms viz., M.tuberculosis and M.leprae. They focused on secreted proteins of pathogens and cellular membrane proteins to restrict to uncovering biologically significant and feasible interactions. Predicted interactions include five mycobacterial proteins of yet unknown function, thus suggesting a role for these proteins in pathogenesis. The authors predict interaction partners for secreted mycobacterial antigens such as MPT70, serine proteases and other proteins interacting with human proteins, such as toll-like receptors, ras signalling proteins and immune maintenance proteins, that are implicated in pathogenesis. These results suggest that the list of predicted interactions is suitable for further analysis and forms a useful step in the understanding of pathogenesis of these mycobacterial organisms. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of age-related dementia, which prominently affects the human connectome. In this paper, the authors focus on the question how they can identify disrupted spatial patterns of the human connectome in AD based on a data mining framework. Using diffusion tractography, the human connectomes for each individual subject were constructed based on two diffusion derived attributes: fiber density and fractional anisotropy, to represent the structural brain connectivity patterns. After frequent subgraph mining, the abnormal score was finally defined to identify disrupted subgraph patterns in patients. Experiments demonstrated that our data-driven approach, for the first time, allows identifying selective spatial pattern changes of the human connectome in AD that perfectly matched grey matter changes of the disease. Their findings also bring new insights into how AD propagates and disrupts the regional integrity of large-scale structural brain networks in a fiber connectivity-based way. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract Searching for correlations between brain structure and attributes of a person’s intellectual state is a process which may be better done by automation than by human labor. Such an automated system would be capable of performing classification based on the discovered correlation, which would be means of testing how accurate the discovered correlation is. The authors have developed a system which generates a graph-based representation of the shape of the third and lateral ventricles based on a structural MRI, and classifies images represented in this manner. The system is evaluated on accuracy at classifying individuals showing cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s Disease. Classification accuracy is 74.2% when individuals with CDR 0.5 are included as impaired in a balanced dataset of 166 images, and 79.3% accuracy when differentiating individuals with CDR at least 1.0 and healthy individuals in a balanced dataset of 54 images. Finally, the system is used to classify MR images according to level of education, with 77.2% accuracy differentiating highly-educated individuals from those for whom no higher education is listed, in a balanced dataset of 178 images. </abstract>

<title>Search for Protein Sequence Homologues that Display Considerable Domain Length Variations.</title>

<abstract>Top Abstract Independent folding units which have the capability of carrying out biological functions have been classified as “protein domains”. These minimal structural units lead not only to considerable sequence changes of protein domains of similar folds and functions, but also gives rise to remarkable length variations under evolutionary pressure. Rapid and heuristic sequence search algorithms are generally sensitive and effective in recognizing protein domains that are distantly related within large sequence databases, but are not well-suited to identify remote homologues of varying lengths. An even more challenging aspect is introduced to distinguish reliable hits from a vast number of putative false positives that could have suboptimal sequence similarities. Here, the authors present a data-mining approach that provides stage-specific filters in sequence searches to reliably accumulate remote homologues, which encourages sampling of length variations albeit with a low false positive rate. Realization of such remote homologues with vivid length variations could contribute to better understanding of functional variety within protein domain superfamilies. </abstract>

<title>Scaling Unsupervised Risk Stratification to Massive Clinical Datasets.</title>
<pages>45-59</pages>
<year>2011</year>
<volume>2</volume>
<journal>IJKDB</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract While rare clinical events, by definition, occur infrequently in a population, the consequences of these events can be drastic. Unfortunately, developing risk stratification algorithms for these conditions requires large volumes of data to capture enough positive and negative cases. This process is slow, expensive, and burdensome to both patients and caregivers. This paper proposes an unsupervised machine learning approach to address this challenge and risk stratify patients for adverse outcomes without use of a priori knowledge or labeled training data. The key idea of the approach is to identify high-risk patients as anomalies in a population. Cases are identified through a novel algorithm that finds an approximate solution to the k-nearest neighbor problem using locality sensitive hashing (LSH) based on p-stable distributions. The algorithm is optimized to use multiple LSH searches, each with a geometrically increasing radius, to find the k-nearest neighbors of patients in a dynamically changing dataset where patients are being added or removed over time. When evaluated on data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), this approach successfully identifies patients at an elevated risk of mortality and rare morbidities. The LSH-based algorithm provided a substantial improvement over an exact k-nearest neighbor algorithm in runtime, while achieving a similar accuracy. </abstract>

<title>Mapping Affymetrix Microarray Probes to the Rat Genome via a Persistent Index.</title>

<number>1</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract A probe mapping technique using a novel implementation of a persistent q-gram index was developed. It guarantees to find all matches that meet certain definitions. These include exact matching of the central 19 bases of 25 base probes, matching the central 19 bases with at most one or three mismatches and exact matching of any 16 bases. In comparison with BLAST and BLAT, the new methods were either significantly faster or identified matches missed by the heuristics. The 16 bp method was used to map the 342,410 perfect match probes from the Affymetrix GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array to the genome. When compared with the mapping from Ensembl, the new mapping included over seven million novel matches, providing additional evidence for researchers wishing to further investigate the sources of signals measured in microarray experiments. The results demonstrate the practicality of the index, which could support other q-gram based algorithms. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract Hospital information systems have been frustrated by problems that include congestion, long wait time, and delayed patient care over decades. To solve these problems, data mining techniques have been used in medical research for many years and are known to be effective. Therefore, this study examines building a hybrid data mining methodology, combining medical domain knowledge and associative classification rules. Real world emergency data are collected from a hospital and the methodology is evaluated by comparing it with other techniques. The methodology is expected to help physicians to make rapid and accurate diagnosis of chest diseases. </abstract>

<title>Dis2PPI: A Workflow Designed to Integrate Proteomic and Genetic Disease Data.</title>

<number>3</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract Experiments in bioinformatics are based on protocols that employ different steps for data mining and data integration, collectively known as computational workflows. Considering the use of databases in the biomedical sciences software that is able to query multiple databases is desirable. Systems biology, which encompasses the design of interactomic networks to understand complex biological processes, can benefit from computational workflows. Unfortunately, the use of computational workflows in systems biology is still very limited, especially for applications associated with the study of disease. To address this limitation, we designed Dis2PPI, a workflow that integrates information retrieved from genetic disease databases and interactomes. Dis2PPI extracts protein names from a disease report and uses this information to mine protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. The data gathered from this mining can be used in systems biology analyses. To demonstrate the functionality of Dis2PPI for systems biology analyses, the authors mined information about xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome, two monogenic diseases that lead to skin cancer when the patients are exposed to sunlight and neurodegeneration. </abstract>

<title>Trend Analysis of Length of Stay Data via Phase-Type Models.</title>

<abstract>Top Abstract The populations in many developed countries throughout the world are aging rapidly and the number of geriatric patients is expected to rise steeply in those countries. This will exert greater pressures on the management of hospital resources as a result. Hospital length of stay (LOS) is an important indicator of hospital activity and management because of its direct relation to resource consumption. Planning of hospital resources according to identified trends of LOS is, thus, an effective way to meet such future needs. In this paper, the authors propose a method to analyze the temporal trends of LOS based on the Coxian phase-type distributions, a special type of continuous-time Markov process. By fitting and regressing the probabilities of discharge from each phase of the distribution on time, the authors have found a growing trend in the proportion of long-staying patients in their sample of stroke patients from a general hospital in Singapore. The authors compare the yearly, quarterly and monthly trends over the same period to see the common pattern. The datasets were also robustified by bootstrapping to aid the analysis. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract Annotating protein structures is an urgent task as increasing number of protein structures of unknown function is being solved. To achieve this goal, it is critical to establish computational methods for characterizing and classifying protein local structures. The authors analyzed the similarity of local surface patches from 609 representative proteins considering shape and the electrostatic potential, which are represented by the 3D Zernike descriptors. Classification of local patches is done with the emergent self-organizing map (ESOM). They mapped patches at ligand binding-sites to investigate how they distribute and cluster among the ESOM map. They obtained 30-50 clusters of local surfaces of different characteristics, which will be useful for annotating surface of proteins. </abstract>

They report the available resources and methodologies used to create a curated compilation of ppis introducing a novel approach to filter interactions. Special attention is paid in the complexity of the topology of the networks formed by proteins (nodes) and pairwise interactions (edges). These networks can be studied using graph theory and a brief introduction to the characterization of biological networks and definitions of the more used network parameters is also given. Also a report on the available resources to perform different modes of functional profiling using ppi data is provided along with a discussion on the approaches that have typically been applied into this context. They also introduce a novel methodology for the evaluation of networks and some examples of its application. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract The main objective of this work is to develop machine learning models for the prediction of patient outcome in nephrology care as well as to validate and optimize the models with a feature selection approach. Cardiovascular events are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients and have an incidence of 20% in the first year of renal replacement therapy. Real data routinely collected during HD administration were extracted from the Fresenius Medical Care database EuCliD (39 independent variables) and used to develop a random forest predictive model to forecast cardiovascular events in the first year of HD treatment. Two feature selection methods were applied. Results of these models in an independent cohort of patients showed a significant predictive ability. The authors’ results were obtained with a random forest built on 6 variables only (AUC: 77.1% ± 2.9%; MCE: 31.6% ± 3.5%), identified by the variable importance out of bag (OOB) estimate. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract The authors analyze the lung cancer data available from the SEER program with the aim of identifying hotspots using association rule mining techniques. A subset of 13 patient attributes from the SEER data were recently linked with the survival outcome using prediction models, which is used in this study for segmentation. The goal here is to identify characteristics of patient segments where average survival is significantly higher/lower than average survival across the entire dataset. Automated association rule mining techniques resulted in hundreds of rules, from which many redundant rules were manually removed based on domain knowledge. Further, association rule mining based hotspot analysis was also conducted for conditional survival patient data, i.e., in cases where patients have already survived for a year after diagnosis. The resulting rules conform with existing biomedical knowledge and provide interesting insights into lung cancer survival. </abstract>

These algorithms can find frequently appearing substructures in discrete data. They can discover structural motifs, for example, from mutation data, protein structures, and chemical compounds. As they have been primarily used for business data, biological applications are not so common yet, but their potential impact would be large. Recent advances in computers including multicore machines and ever increasing memory capacity support the application of such methods to larger datasets. The author explains technical aspects of the algorithms, but do not go into details. Current biological applications are summarized and possible future directions are given. </abstract>

<title>Figure Based Biomedical Document Retrieval System using Structural Image Features.</title>

<number>1</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract Multi-modal and Unstructured nature of documents make their retrieval from healthcare document repositories a challenging task. Text based retrieval is the conventional approach used for solving this problem. In this paper, the authors explore an alternate avenue of using embedded figures for the retrieval task. Usually, context of a document is directly reflected in the associated figures, therefore embedded text within these figures along with image features have been used for similarity based retrieval of figures. The present work demonstrates that image features describing the structural properties of figures are sufficient for the figure retrieval task. First, the authors analyze the problem of figure retrieval from biomedical literature and identify significant classes of figures. Second, they use edge information as a means to discriminate between structural properties of each figure category. Finally, the authors present a methodology using a novel feature descriptor namely Fourier Edge Orientation Autocorrelogram (FEOAC) to describe structural properties of figures and build an effective Biomedical document retrieval system. The experimental results demonstrate the better retrieval performance and overall improvement of FEOAC for figure retrieval task, especially when most of the edge information is retained. Apart from invariance to scale, rotation and non-uniform illumination, the proposed feature descriptor is shown to be relatively robust to noisy edges. </abstract>

<number>3</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract Protein classification can be performed by representing 3-D protein structures by graphs and then classifying the corresponding graphs. One effective way to classify such graphs is to use frequent subgraph patterns as features; however, the effectiveness of using subgraph patterns in graph classification is often hampered by the large search space of subgraph patterns. In this paper, the authors present two efficient discriminative subgraph mining algorithms: COM and GAIA. These algorithms directly search for discriminative subgraph patterns rather than frequent subgraph patterns which can be used to generate classification rules. Experimental results show that COM and GAIA can achieve high classification accuracy and runtime efficiency. Additionally, they find substructures that are very close to the proteins’ actual active sites. </abstract>

<title>Mining Protein Interactome Networks to Measure Interaction Reliability and Select Hub Proteins.</title>

<year>2010</year>
<volume>1</volume>
<journal>IJKDB</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract High-throughput techniques involve large-scale detection of protein-protein interactions. This interaction data set from the genome-scale perspective is structured into an interactome network. Since the interaction evidence represents functional linkage, various graph-theoretic computational approaches have been applied to the interactome networks for functional characterization. However, this data is generally unreliable, and the typical genome-wide interactome networks have a complex connectivity. In this paper, the authors explore systematic analysis of protein interactome networks, and propose a $k$-round signal flow simulation algorithm to measure interaction reliability from connection patterns of the interactome networks. This algorithm quantitatively characterizes functional links between proteins by simulating the propagation of information signals through complex connections. In this regard, the algorithm efficiently estimates the strength of alternative paths for each interaction. The authors also present an algorithm for mining the complex interactome network structure. The algorithm restructures the network by hierarchical ordering of nodes, and this structure re-formatting process reveals hub proteins in the interactome networks. This paper demonstrates that two rounds of simulation accurately scores interaction reliability in terms of ontological correlation and functional consistency. Finally, the authors validate that the selected structural hubs represent functional core proteins. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract Inferring the relationship among proteins is a central issue of computational biology and a diversity of biological assays are utilized to predict the relationship. However, as experiments are usually expensive to perform, automatic data selection is employed to reduce the data collection cost. Although data useful for link prediction are different in each local sub-network, existing methods cannot select different data for different processes. This article presents a new algorithm for inferring biological networks from multiple types of assays. The proposed algorithm is based on transfer learning and can exploit local information effectively. Each assay is automatically weighted through learning and the weights can be adaptively different in each local part. The authors’ algorithm was favorably examined on two kinds of biological networks: a metabolic network and a protein interaction network. A statistical test confirmed that the weight that our algorithm assigned to each assay was meaningful. </abstract>

<title>Infer Species Phylogenies Using Self-Organizing Maps.</title>
<pages>29-49</pages>
<year>2010</year>
<volume>1</volume>
<journal>IJKDB</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract With rapid advances in genomics, phylogenetics has turned to phylogenomics due to the availability of large amounts of sequence and genome data. However, incongruence between species trees and gene trees remains a challenge in molecular phylogenetics for its biological and algorithmic complexities. A state-of-the-art gene concatenation approach was proposed to resolve this problem by inferring the species phylogeny using a random combination of widely distributed orthologous genes screened from genomes. However, such an approach may not be a robust solution to this problem because it ignores the fact that some genes are more informative than others in species inference. This paper presents a self-organizing map (SOM) based phylogeny inference method to overcome its weakness. The author’s proposed algorithm not only demonstrates its superiority to the original gene concatenation method by using same datasets, but also shows its advantages in generalization. This paper illustrates that data missing may not play a negative role in phylogeny inferring. This study presents a method to cluster multispecies genes, estimate multispecies gene entropy and visualize the species patterns through the self-organizing map mining. </abstract>

<title>PASS2: A Database of Structure-Based Sequence Alignments of Protein Structural Domain Superfamilies.</title>
<pages>53-66</pages>
<year>2011</year>
<volume>2</volume>
<journal>IJKDB</journal>
<number>4</number>
<abstract>Top Abstract A detailed comparison of protein domains that belong to families and superfamilies shows that structure is better conserved than sequence during evolutionary divergence. Sequence alignments, guided by structural features, permit a better sampling of the protein sequence space and effective construction of libraries for fold recognition. Sequence alignments are useful evolutionary models in defining structure-function relationships for protein superfamilies. The PASS2 database, maintained by the authors, presents alignments of proteins related at the superfamily level and characterised by low sequence similarity. The number of new superfamilies increased to 47% compared with the previous PASS2 version, which shows the crucial importance of updating the PASS2 database. In the current release of the PASS2 database, they align protein superfamilies using a structural alignment protocol. The authors also introduce two alignment assessment methods that depend on the average structural deviations of domains and the extent of conserved secondary structures. They also integrate new and important structural and sequence features at the superfamily level into the database. These features are conserved-unconserved blocks in proteins, spatial distribution of sequences using principal component analysis and a statistical view for each superfamily. The authors suggest that highly structurally deviant superfamily members could be removed as outliers, so that such extreme distant relationships will not obscure the alignment. They report a nearly-automated, updated version of the superfamily alignment database, consisting of 1776 superfamilies and 9536 protein domains, that is in direct correspondence with the SCOP (1.73) database. </abstract>

<abstract>Top Abstract In the field of genetic research and the subsequent rise of biobanks an intensive discussion is taking place on national and international levels about property and personality rights to one's own body and body parts. The authors attempt to develop on the basis of the current controversially discussed law a concept of property, which can solve the legal and bioethical problems of the multiple use of human samples. Therefore, the question will be discussed whether a person is eligible to claim property rights to the tissue, which was separated from him. The authors' opinion is that this person only looses his property rights when all data are completely anonymised. Also the trustee model could be an efficient model, in which the tissue is safeguarded and pseudonymised by a trustee, to preserve the interests of the former owner of the human samples, but concurrently support the interests of the users. </abstract>

<abstract>Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) has been identified as a key concept within manufacturing industries for improving product quality, time-to-market and costs. Previous works on this field are focused on processes, functions and information models, and those aimed at putting more intelligence on products are related to specific parts of the product lifecycle (e.g. supply chain management, shop floor control). Therefore, there is a lack of a holistic approach to PLM, putting more intelligence on products through the complete lifecycle. In this paper, a PLM framework supported by a proactive approach based on intelligent agents is proposed. The developed model aims at being a first step toward a reference framework for PLM, and complements past works on both product information and business process models (BPM), by putting proactivity on product's behavior. An example of an instantiation of the reference framework is presented as a case study.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper develops a joint approach to solve the problem of integrated scheduling of different types of material handling equipment in a typical automated air cargo handling system. Due to the nature of the operations, the schedules for different cooperating equipment are highly interactive. In order to formally describe the interactive properties of cooperating equipment, an event framework for the specification of an automated cargo handling system and a model for the integrated scheduling for more than one type of cooperating equipment is developed. A heuristic algorithm, known as the extended maximum-matching algorithm (EMMA), is proposed to solve the joint scheduling problem. The performance of the proposed EMMA is evaluated via extensive numerical studies. Experimental results show that the EMMA can be readily adapted to real-world applications.</abstract>

<abstract>Today, the realization of the Digital Factory is the strategic goal of many manufacturing enterprises for the coming years. Up to now, the work has focused on the technical linkage of various planning tools. Now, the goal is to integrate aspects of the Digital Factory into the planning processes. Therefore, it is necessary to define a semantic correlation between the distributed models as well as the associated databases. Furthermore, a suitable presentation method has to be selected which is appropriate for the application within a specific task and for a specific target group.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper describes an approach for developing and implementing a service- and multi-agent-oriented manufacturing automation architecture, being particularly focused on functional features of the IEC 62264 L2 standard. The proposed SoA architecture facilitates managing and controlling networked smart automation components in a distributed manufacturing environment. The services, generated and exposed by automation components located on the levels 1 and 2 of the ISA’95-compliant enterprise architecture, are essential part of an “Automation Service Cloud”, which is the result of the virtualization of the physical production environment. Moreover, these services can be accessed, requested and used by other components of these and upper levels, i.e., MES (Manufacturing Executing System) distributed components like a collaborative multi-agent-based manufacturing scheduling and dispatching system. Using the main characteristics of the service-orientation, the automation services can be composed and orchestrated in the cloud, creating emergent behaviors, which is a direct result of the virtualization, i.e., transforming the mechatronics/production layout into an automatically collaborative network.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper, a new approach has been developed to recognize the CAD models through their face adjacency relations and attributes and to automatically assemble the recognized parts in a CAD environment. Adjacent faces and the face attributes belonging to each face of parts designed in a CAD platform are derived by using of standard for the exchange of product data (STEP) file. They are represented in a square matrix format named face oriented relation matrix (FORM). An expert system was developed and embedded within the system. A knowledge base of the expert system is generated using a text editor. Reasoning the face adjacency relations and the face attributes in the knowledge base and FORM, the parts are recognized. Then, a reference face belonging to recognized parts is determined and they are positioned and assembled in assembly file through their reference faces. Part recognition approach developed in this study is applied to a computer aided assembly system. But it may be useful and practical for different CAD/CAM applications such as process planning and group technology too. The algorithm has been applied to a diesel automobile engine which has complex parts to demonstrate its efficiency and capability.</abstract>

<abstract>One-of-a-kind production (OKP) aims at manufacturing products based on the individual customer requirements while maintaining the high quality and efficiency of mass production. This paper presents a customer-centric product modeling scheme to model OKP product families by considering the relations between customer needs and OKP products. In this modeling scheme, an OKP product family is modeled by an AND-OR tree. In order to investigate the relations between customer needs and OKP products, data mining techniques are employed to achieve knowledge from the historical data. First, OKP products and customer requirements are grouped into product patterns and customer patterns, respectively, using a fuzzy pattern clustering method. Then, hybrid attribute reduction is carried out based on rough set theory to remove the irrelevant attributes for each product pattern. Finally, the relationships between product patterns and customer patterns are obtained. Based on the achieved knowledge, the different patterns of OKP products are modeled by different sub-AND-OR trees trimmed from the original AND-OR tree. Since only partial product descriptions in a product family are used to identify the optimal custom product based on customer requirements, the efficiency of custom product identification process can be improved considerably.</abstract>

<title>Knowledge capitalisation based on textual and graphical semi-structured and non-structured information: case study in an industrial research centre at EADS.</title>

<abstract>The aim of an industrial research centre is to produce knowledge to answer the requirements of operational units. So the constraints of cost, delay and quality also apply to research activities. Consequently, industrial research centres need to be rationalized, including the design and engineering system departments. They have to optimise internal and external knowledge flows. To this end, after describing knowledge and information typologies in engineering activities, a knowledge management system is proposed. The goal is to support: (1) semi-structured information (e.g. reports, journal articles, etc.) thanks to the ANITA tool functions, which are based on attributing points of view and annotations to documents but also to document zones, and (2) non-structured information, one of the important aspects of research activities that concerns common resolution of research problems within project teams. In the latter context, the MICA approach intends to support exchange of technical messages (dialogues) and to capitalise relevant knowledge.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper describes the development of a prototype software package for solving functional dimensioning and tolerancing (FD&T) problems in a Concurrent Engineering environment. It provides a systematic way of converting functional requirements of a product into dimensional specifications by means of the following steps: firstly, the relationships necessary for solving FD&T problems are represented in a matrix form, known as functional requirements/dimensions (FR/D) matrix. Secondly, the values of dimensions and tolerances are then determined by satisfying all these relationships represented in a FR/D matrix by applying a comprehensive strategy which includes: tolerance allocation strategies for different types of FD&T problems and for determining an optimum solution order for coupled functional equations. The prototype software is evaluated by its potential users, and the results indicate that it can be an effective computer-based tool for solving FD&T problems in a CE environment.</abstract>

<abstract>The research literature on ERP systems has exponentially grown in recent years. In a domain, where new concepts and techniques are constantly introduced, it is therefore, of interest to analyze the recent trends of this literature, which is only partially included in the research papers published. Therefore, we have chosen to primarily analyze the literature of the last 2 years (2003 and 2004), on the basis of a classification according to six categories: implementation of ERP; optimisation of ERP; management through ERP; the ERP software; ERP for supply chain management; case studies. This survey confirms that the research on ERP systems is still a growing field, but has reached some maturity. Different research communities address this area from various points of view. Among the research axes that are now active, we can, especially, notice a growing interest on the post-implementation phase of the projects, on the customization of ERP systems, on the sociological aspects of the implementation, on the interoperability of the ERP with other systems and on the return on investment of the implementations.</abstract>

<abstract>There is an opportunity for real-estate services sector to deliver more accurate, faster and quality building surveys and information models. This paper reports on a study, designed to establish automated procedures for the development of a digital model to assist in faster and better services and delivery of real-estate services by integrating 3D laser scanning and BIM technology. It proposes an intuitive and interactive building model that is easy to query and navigate, and thus support property developers, buyers and sellers in the property sales sector. An outline of the new approach is provided to illustrate the benefits of the proposed method to the real-estate services sector. The key arguments in the paper are consolidated by the results of a qualitative study amongst real-estate professionals, which sought to determine the added value of BIM-3D laser scanning in comparison to conventional building surveying and Computer Aided Design (CAD) methods.</abstract>

<abstract>We propose a garment-fitting system for an online retail model, which uses a consumer's 3D body data for garment fitting. This system uses front and back images to model the garment and 3D laser scanned body data to model the body. In order to recognize characteristic points on the 3D body data, a moment template composed of central moments of vector angle sets on 3D body data is proposed, and an implementation combining the 3D data and garment images is reported, which includes modeling, collision detection and feedback handling. The resulting system would support an online retail business model for garments. In the proposed business model, a body data center would scan the body and store the 3D data, the simulated garment-fitting program would be provided to individual consumers for fitting on a home PC, and retail shops would exhibit garment images on their websites. In this proposed model, security of personal data and computational cost will not be an issue.</abstract>

<abstract>Innovation is one of the keys to success in the business world, particularly within the current economic climate. R&D projects constitute the building blocks of the innovation process, hence the importance of searching for funding for these projects. As ontologies and semantic technologies mature, they provide a consistent and reliable means to represent and aggregate knowledge from different sources. The present work explores the use of ontologies to model R&D grant funding calls and the application of semantic technologies to the development of an enhanced funding management system. Our experiments confirm the success of the proposed approach, and reveal that it may bring considerable benefits to R&D funding.</abstract>

<title>SIMAP: Intelligent System for Predictive Maintenance: Application to the health condition monitoring of a windturbine gearbox.</title>

<abstract>SIMAP is the abbreviated name for the Intelligent System for Predictive Maintenance. It is a software application addressed to the diagnosis in real-time of industrial processes. It takes into account the information coming in real-time from different sensors and other information sources and tries to detect possible anomalies in the normal behaviour expected of the industrial components. The incipient detection of anomalies allows for an early diagnosis and the possibility to plan effective maintenance actions. Also, the continuous monitoring performed allows for an estimation in a qualitative form of the health condition of the components. SIMAP is a general tool oriented to the diagnosis and maintenance of industrial processes, however the first experience of its application has been at a windfarm. In this real case, SIMAP is able to optimize and to dynamically adapt a maintenance calendar for a monitored windturbine according to the real needs and operating life of it as well as other technical and economical criteria. In particular this paper presents the application of SIMAP to the health condition monitoring of a windturbine gearbox as an example of its capabilities and main features.</abstract>

<title>New trends on e-Procurement applying semantic technologies: Current status and future challenges.</title>
<pages>800-820</pages>

<abstract>The present paper introduces and reviews existing technology and research works in the field of e-Procurement. More specifically this survey aims to collect those relevant approaches that have tackled the challenge of delivering more advanced and intelligent e-Procurement management systems due to its relevance in the industry to afford more timely, adaptable and flexible decisions in purchasing processes. Although existing tools and techniques have demonstrated their ability to manage e-Procurement processes as a part of a supply management system there is a lack of interoperability among tools, tangled dependencies between processes or difficulties to exploit existing data and information to name a few that are preventing a proper use of the new dynamic and data-based environment. On the other hand semantic-based technologies emerge to provide the adequate building blocks to represent domain-knowledge and elevate the meaning of information resources through a common and shared data model (RDF) with a formal query language (SPARQL) and accessible via the Internet Protocols. In this sense the Linked Data effort has gained momentum to apply the principles of the aforementioned initiative to boost the re-use of information and data across different tools and processes. That is why authors review both existing open issues in the context e-Procurement with special focus on public procurement and semantic-based approaches to address them. To do so a preliminary research study is conducted to assess the state of the art in the context of e-Procurement and semantic-based systems. Afterwards main drawbacks of existing e-Procurement systems are presented to narrow down in semantic-based approaches applied to this field. Once the current status in both areas is reviewed, authors purpose the use and creation of an e-Procurement index to evaluate the quality of service of procurement systems. In this light the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is used to set up an initial weight for each indicator in the index and to perform a first comparison between traditional and semantic-based approaches. Finally some discussion, conclusions and future challenges are also outlined.</abstract>

<abstract>Business process discovery is a basis for analyzing an enterprise's current business and is a critical key to enterprises seeking to be more process-centric today. Challenges in business process discovery include the complexity of the enterprise and the interactions among its units, the inaccuracy and incompleteness of available business information, and the dynamic changing businesses in the enterprise. In this paper, a three-layered architecture mixing the top–down and bottom–up methodology is proposed to address the above issues. Technical details of the three layers, namely the Component layer, the Operation Integration layer and the Operation layer are discussed. Moreover, a model checking based verification approach is also integrated in the method to verify the discovered business process against the desired business requirements from analysts. Finally, a case study in a furniture manufacturing enterprise in China is illustrated to prove the effectiveness of our method.</abstract>

<title>Management of lifecycle costs and benefits: Lessons from information systems practice.</title>

<abstract>Assessing the economic feasibility of information systems (IS) projects and operations remains a challenge for most organizations. This research investigates lifecycle cost and benefit management practices and demonstrates that, overall, although organizations intend to improve their information technology (IT) management, they squander many opportunities to do so. There are inconsistencies in cost/benefit management practices. Most organizations that integrate operational benefits into investment analyses do not acknowledge operational costs. Planned project goals are seldom formulated in a verifiable or measurable way; there is little structured feedback on individual lifecycle activities, nor co-ordination of various activities. Thus, the attitude towards cost/benefit management appears primarily context-related and incident-driven. A further development of the system lifecycle-based approach is needed to improve IT cost/benefit management theory and practice, because a coherent set of methods is required to assess IT costs and benefits throughout the entire lifecycle.</abstract>

<abstract>Range imaging based on the Time-of-Flight (ToF) principle evolved largely in recent years. Especially, the lateral resolution, the ability to operate outdoors with sunlight and the sensitivity have been improved. Nevertheless, the acceptance of depth cameras for machine vision in the industry environment is still rather limited. The major shortcoming of ToF depth cameras compared to laser range scanners is their measuring accuracy, which is not sufficient for several applications. In this paper, we firstly introduce several state of the art depth cameras briefly and demonstrate their capabilities. Afterwards, we explore possibilities to increase the radial resolution and the accuracy of ToF depth cameras based on the Photonic Mixer Device (PMD). In general, the usage of higher modulation frequencies promises higher depth resolution but yields on the other hand higher noise levels. Moreover, the accuracy is limited by systematic errors and the measurement are affected by random noise and we show how to minimize and compensate them in industry environments.</abstract>

<abstract>Mobility, cooperation and the information access of the different human actors within a complex industrial organization are some of the concerns of web-based HMI design. In this paper we highlight the application of some key concepts of web services for the specification and design of a complex supervisory web-based HMI. Hence, a novel approach based on a service oriented architecture and web services allowing flexible and transparent interaction between the field devices and human operators currently being considered is now possible. An overall design framework is presented and discussed. A real representative case study illustrating this approach is described and discussed from the human–machine interaction point of view, as well as further work.</abstract>

<title>Mediation of foundation ontology based knowledge sources.</title>

<year>2012</year>
<volume>63</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>Ontologies are helpful in giving interoperable structures to sources of knowledge and information. This interoperability, however, is greatly hindered by the heterogeneity of independently developed ontologies which in turn increases the requirements for mediation systems to reconcile the differences. A core concepts ontology for a certain domain contained by a foundation ontology can be used to alleviate this problem and to facilitate the reconciliation efforts. Possible differences in the use of concepts from the core concepts to model entities in domain ontologies can be prevented by binding the domain ontology developers to some rules. These rules can be particularly useful for domain ontologies requiring some kind of traceability of their concepts in the foundation ontology. The mediation system can then use this traceability to establish similarities between two ontologies. Software applications, like the one explained in this paper, can then be developed to perform the mediation task automatically and accurately.</abstract>

<title>A solution to the unequal area facilities layout problem by genetic algorithm.</title>

<volume>56</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>The majority of the issued facilities layout problems (FLPs) minimize the material handling cost and ignore other factors, such as area utilization, department shape and site shape size. These factors, however, might influence greatly the objective function and should give consideration. The research range of this paper is focus on the unequal areas department facilities layout problem, and implement analysis of variance (ANOVA) of statistics to find out the best site size of layout by genetic algorithm. The proposed module takes the minimum total layout cost (TLC) into account. TLC is an objective function combining material flow factor cost (MFFC), shape ratio factor (SRF) and area utilization factor (AUF). In addition, a rule-based of expert system is implemented to create space-filling curve for connecting each unequal area department to be continuously placed without disjoint (partition). In this manner, there is no gap between each unequal area department. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is more feasible in dealing with the facilities layout problems in the real world.</abstract>

<title>Study of the performance of multi-behaviour agents for supply chain planning.</title>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>In today's industrial context, competitiveness is closely associated to supply chain performance. Coordination between business units is essential to increase this performance, in order to produce and deliver products on time to customers, at a competitive price. While planning systems usually follow a single straightforward production planning process, this paper proposes that partners adapt together their local planning process (i.e. planning behaviours) to the different situations met in the supply chain environment. Because each partner can choose different behaviour and all behaviours will have an impact on the overall performance, it is difficult to know which is preferable for each partner to increase their performance. Using agent-based technology, simulation experiments have been undertaken to verify if multi-behaviour planning agents who can change planning behaviours to adapt to their environment can increase supply chain performance. These agents have been implemented in an agent-based planning platform, using a case study illustrating a lumber supply chain. The performance analysis shows that advanced planning systems can take advantage of using multiple planning processes, because of the dynamic context of supply chains.</abstract>

<abstract>The design of software architectures for the control of complex systems is a difficult task. In particular, it requires the appropriate means to define then integrate behaviors in a flexible way. Design patterns proved efficient, in terms of flexibility and integration, in the field of software design in general. This paper extends two well-known design patterns in order to adapt them in the field of control. These new patterns describe how to specify behaviors and define the means to combine and adapt them. The interest of these patterns is illustrated by the example of the control of a legged robot.</abstract>

<title>A scene graph based visualization method for representing continuous simulation data.</title>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>This paper proposes a scene graph based visualization method that can verify time-varying continuous analysis simulation in a virtual reality (VR) environment by using the computer-aided engineering (CAE) data of structural analysis in product development. In previous research, the use of CAE analysis data has been problematic because of the lack of any interactive simulation controls for visualizing continuous simulation data. Moreover, the research on post-processing methods for real-time evaluation of CAE analysis data has not been sufficient. We therefore propose a scene graph based visualization method for representing continuous simulation data. The method can continuously visualize static analysis data independently of any timeline; it can also continuously visualize dynamic analysis data that varies in relation to the timeline. The visualization system for continuous simulation data, which includes CAE2VR Middleware that interfaces with various formats of CAE analysis data as well as functions for visualizing continuous simulation data and operational functions, enables users to verify simulation results with more realistic scenes.</abstract>

<abstract>The analysis of the interactive relations among interface elements using a structuralized method can help user interface designers to satisfy the different requirements of design and improve design efficiency. This study develops a three-stage structured user interface design approach for complex information systems consisting of multiple components. First, the Quality Function Development (QFD) approach is used to confirm the user's design demand and its mapping components. Next, the Interpretive Structural Model (ISM) technique is adopted to construct a clear model of a hierarchical structure. Finally, the Impact Matrix Cross-Reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification (MICMAC) approach is employed to analyze the effect and dependence among the overall design components, and to consider the relationship network graph of distribution of components in the system. The research approach applies the Web mail system as its case study. Through the empirical study of web-based system, interface designers can effectively grasp a user's differentiated demand that changes rapidly and reflect it in the combination of designed components. This study establishes a strategy for creating an information system design pattern with multiple components is by building a hierarchical structure and analyzing the component distribution.</abstract>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>This paper presents an exemplar-based method to provide intuitive way for users to generate 3D human body shape from semantic parameters. In our approach, human models and their semantic parameters are correlated as a single linear system of equations. When users input a new set of semantic parameters, a new 3D human body will be synthesized from the exemplar human bodies in the database. This approach involves simpler computation compared to non-linear methods while maintaining quality outputs. A semantic parametric design in interactive speed can be implemented easily. Furthermore, a new method is developed to quickly predict whether the parameter values is reasonable or not, with the training models in the human body database. The reconstructed human bodies in this way will all have the same topology (i.e., mesh connectivity), which facilitates the freeform design automation of human-centric products.</abstract>

<abstract>The Service-Oriented-Architecture (SOA) development paradigm has emerged to make an improvement in critical situations such as creating, modifying and extending solutions in the domain of business processes integration. Web services technologies are considered as the main units for SOA, for both intra- and inter-enterprise communication. Nevertheless, SOA does not have information about the events that occurs in business processes, which represents the main characteristics of supply chain management. Taking this into account, this paper proposes a middleware-oriented integrated architecture with the use of semantic features (concretely with the use of Linked Data) as data provider to offer a brokerage service for the procurement of products in a Supply Chain Management (SCM). As main contributions, our system provides a hybrid architecture that combines features of both SOA and EDA between several others.</abstract>

<abstract>A key aspect of competition in industrial maintenance is the trade-off between cost and risk. Decision-making is dependent upon up-to-date information about distributed and disparate plant, coupled with knowledge of sensitive non-technical issues. Enabling technologies such as the Internet are making strides in improving the quantity and quality of data, particularly by improving links with other information systems. In maintenance, the problem of disparate data sources is important. It is very difficult to make optimal decisions because the information is not easily obtained and merged. Information about technical state or machine health, cost of maintenance activities or loss of production, and non-technical risk factors such as customer information, is required. Even in the best information systems, these are not defined in the same units, and are not presented on a consistent time scale; typically, they are in different information systems. Some data is continuously updated, e.g. condition data, but the critical risk information is typically drawn from a historical survey, fixed in time.</abstract>

<abstract>In this study, an image analysis-based ore quality monitoring system was developed. The study was conducted at a limestone mine located in India. The samples were collected based on a stratified random sampling method, and images of these samples were taken in a simulated environment in a laboratory. The image preprocessing and segmentation were performed using different segmentation methods to extract morphological, colour and textural features. A total of 189 features was extracted during this study. Principal components analysis was conducted to reduce the feature vector for modeling purposes. Five principal components, which were extracted from the feature vectors, captured 95% of the total feature variance. A neural network model was used as a mapping function for ore grade prediction. The five principal components were used as input, and four grade attributes of limestone (CaO, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and SiO2) were used as output. The developed model was then used for day to day quality monitoring at 3 different face locations of the mine. Results revealed that this technique can be successfully used for ore grade monitoring at the mine level in a controlled environment.</abstract>

<title>Knowledge-intensive collaborative design modeling and support: Part II: System implementation and application.</title>

<abstract>Contemporary design problems embody significant levels of complexity, which make it unlikely that a single designer can work alone on a complex design problem. Knowledge-intensive collaboration has emerged as a promising discipline for dealing with the modeling and decision-making processes in distributed design systems. In this paper, we present the implementation and application of a web-based knowledge-intensive collaborative design support system called WebKIDSS. With the modularization of design, a modules networked system could be developed and deployed according to CORBA standard to facilitate the rapid construction of the concurrent integrated distributed models for the design process and the coordination among designers within the range of enterprises and even virtual enterprises. The prototype web-based collaborative design platform, is implemented for proof-of-concept through the distributed knowledge server based framework (KS-DMME) with concurrent integration of multiple cooperative knowledge sources and software using Java/Java Bean and CORBA technologies. The unified user interface of the WebKIDSS provides a cross-platform for distributed users to access to module servers throughout the network. By use of the developed the prototype system, collaborative design can be carried out in an integrated and distributed open environment on the internet/intranet. Based on the preliminary application to the collaborative design of a micro robotic assembly system on the Internet, the developed system indicates some advantages to increase the efficiency of the design coordination and decision-making in the design process.</abstract>

<title>OWL/SWRL representation methodology for EXPRESS-driven product information model: Part II: Practice.</title>

<abstract>This paper continues the study of the ontology-based approach. The emphasis is placed on the practice of the representation methodology. The integrated and application framework for the knowledge-based product information model in OWL/SWRL is described. The interoperation between the product information model and existing rule engines is discussed. As most rule engines have their own fact and rule syntax different from OWL/SWRL, Jess, a Java-based rule engine, is employed to perform the inference and the transformation between the OWL/SWRL and Jess syntax by means of XSLT is investigated. In order to access the product information, querying methods are also introduced. The practice is illustrated through stand-alone experimental applications, oriented to the ontology stemming from a test case of a product information model in EXPRESS language. Meanwhile, the present study proves the feasibility and validity of ontologies as a support to product data exchange, information and knowledge sharing, and reasoning.</abstract>

<title>Product lifecycle management for automotive development focusing on supplier integration.</title>

<abstract>The past years have seen growing investments in the area of product lifecycle management (PLM) by the automotive sector. Due to its complex development cycle, the automotive OEM has begun to adopt the supplier integration into its product development process. To respond to this new trend, the PLM system needs to evolve to support the collaboration and partnership management between the automotive OEM and associated suppliers. Regarding the depth of collaboration, the integration of supplier into OEM process chain has been defined in two ways, quasi-supplier integration and full supplier integration. To enable the success of supplier integration, one of the PLM tasks is to control the collaboration between the automotive OEM and its suppliers, through deciding on an appropriate supplier integration way. Meanwhile, aiming at reduction of the expenditure for partnership management and coordination, the automotive OEM tends to have direct connections with limited number of capable and effective suppliers, called system suppliers. Other suppliers, called sub-suppliers no longer directly communicate with the automotive OEM, but instead with a system supplier who works closer with the automotive OEM and deals with the task of sub-supplier management and coordination. To keep up with these tasks above, a PLM framework is established in a broader perspective in this paper, enabling supplier integration and partnership management in the automotive development process all along the life cycle. Finally, an automotive case study is presented to illustrate the PLM implementation procedure focusing on supplier integration.</abstract>

<abstract>The aim of this study is to increase power/weight ratio of a steel-alloyed vehicle body without any structural weakness and to use an integrated engineering solution of “computer-aided design, engineering and optimization (CADO)”. In this optimization study, primarily the body's “computer-aided design (CAD)” parametric model has been prepared for some static analyses are essential for the design study. In the following step, some critical dimensions of the structure's parts have been defined as design parameters. The goal of the optimization study is a minimization of critical equivalent stress value is under the yield limit. In addition, a sensitivity study has been made on the body model with stress measures for an in-depth analysis. In various steps, Pro/Engineer CAD and Pro/MECHANICA computer-aided engineering (CAE) software has been used. Finally, the obtained results have been presented as both visually and in diagrams or tables. In other words, this study can be defined as a computer-aided design and optimization application of a sophisticated three-dimensional (3D) sheet-metal structural model. Consequently, for the solution of a sophisticated structural design problem, it has been seen that integrated CAD/CAE programs supported optimization techniques are vital much more proper to provide the time, error and cost reduction compared to classical design processes, can be given as contributes of this study to previous literature.</abstract>

<abstract>Nowadays, one of the important objectives of research in the enterprise modelling domain is the development of a unified language, often called UEML (Unified Enterprise Modelling Language). UEML is expected to be a pivot language in order to manage the large amount of enterprise modelling languages and then to increase the interoperability in the domain of enterprise modelling. This paper is focused on one of the more illuminating aspects of UEML: the comparison of the constructs of the enterprise modelling language. Thus, the objective of this paper is to propose an approach allowing to provide some help concerning the identification of whose constructs are needed in UEML. This approach is based on the language meta-modelling, by using Unified Modelling Language (UML) language, and on the set theory. It is applied on a simple example of model translation between the SADT activity and the GRAI activity of GRAI nets.</abstract>

<abstract>The real-time system uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) with associative memory for training and recognition. This study attempts to use associative memory to apply pattern recognition (PR) technology to the real-time pattern recognition of engineering components in a web-based recognition system with a client–server network structure. Remote engineers can draw the shape of the engineering components using the browser, and the recognition system then searches the component database via the Internet. Component patterns are stored in the database system considered here. Moreover, the data fields of each component pattern contain the properties and specifications of that pattern, except in the case of engineering components. The database system approach significantly improves recognition system capacity. The recognition system examined here employs parallel computing, which increases system recognition rate. The recognition system used in this work is an Internet based client–server network structure. The final phase of the system recognition applies database matching technology to processing recognition, and can solve the problem of spurious states. The system considered here is implemented on the Yang-Fen Automation Electrical Engineering Company as a case study. The experiment is continued for 4 months, and engineers are also used to operating the web-based pattern recognition system. Therefore, the cooperative plan described above is analyzed and discussed here. Finally, these papers propose the tradition methods compare with the innovative methods.</abstract>

<title>Modeling an e-based real-time quality control information system in distributed manufacturing shops.</title>

<abstract>In a distributed manufacturing shop (DMS), factories of various levels of manufacturing capabilities are equipped with diverse types of machines and tools and are scattered around many geographically different locations. Because of such geographical diversity, the quality control of sub-assemble products (SAP) is of great importance to ensure a high level of production quality. To address the challenges of DMS management, manufacturers need to access real-time operational information captured from multiple locations. A real-time quality control information system (RTQCIS) can help control the flow of quality-related information among shop floors in the production network. This paper suggests a unique design of RTQCIS based on a new mathematical model. This model concentrates on converting multi-attribute quality measurements into a quality value corresponding to each entity in the quality space. To validate the proposed approach a prototype e-RTQCIS–DMS is developed and applied to subcontractors of an automobile company.</abstract>

<abstract>Existing web services specifications lack an appropriate semantic framework for the creation and operation of emerging manufacturing systems such as the supply chains and extended/virtual enterprises (EE/VE) in order to execute business processes over internet. Semantic web services (SWS) technology aims to add sufficient semantics to the specifications and implementations of web services to make possible the (automatic) integration of distributed autonomous systems, with independently designed data and behaviour models. Defining data, behaviour and system components in a machine understandable way using ontologies provides the basis for reducing the need for humans to be in the loop for routine system integration processes. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a unique bid auction application for procurement automation within supply chains embedded in extended and virtual enterprises. We show how emerging semantic web services technologies such as the web services execution environment (WSMX) facilitate the creation of such applications, and we discuss the advantages of such applications.</abstract>

<abstract>In this work we propose an implementation of IEC 61131-3 Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) software model based on ADA programming language. The guidelines for an IEC 61131-3 to ADA translator are shown. This translator would allow obtaining executable code after compiling the ADA code. In this way, most error conditions that the standard foresees for PLC systems can be managed by the usual ADA compilers or the run-time environment, thus improving software quality. In addition, we show how to manage user- or system-defined error conditions in two ways: first, by proposing ADA-like exception statements in IEC languages; second, by showing an implementation of the error tasks that are explained in part 8 of IEC 61131 standard. Therefore, we conclude that ADA is a suitable target language for PLC.</abstract>

<abstract>As outsourcing of software is a growing market, the need for subcontracting also increases. Frequently, questions are asked like: ‘What is the quality of my subcontractor? Or, is this company able to produce part(s) of our software?’ Although asking the question is easy, answering it is confronted by the problem: ‘How to assess the potential subcontractor before the product exists?’ A range of assessment methods has been defined over the years as the result of in-house as well as public standardization projects. In this paper, the authors present an analysis of these existing methods and propose a ‘best-of’ approach: the so-called MASS: Method for Assessing Software Subcontractors.</abstract>

<abstract>Today, feature-based process planning has been popular in academia and industry with its ability to rigorously integrate design and manufacturing. To date, research on feature sequencing is mainly focused on using expert systems or knowledge-based systems, geometric based approaches, unsupervised-learning or artificial neural network, and genetic algorithms. The approach presented in this paper, however, is a hybrid one using both knowledge-based rules and geometric reasoning rules. In addition to feature sequencing rules formulation, our research contributions consist of: (1) determining machining precedence constraints by a set of defined knowledge-based rules, (2) grouping machining features into setups based on tool approaching directions, and (3) sequencing features within each setup through geometric reasoning. The sequence of materials (features) to be removed depends on two types of interactions: adjacent interaction and volumetric interaction. A set of rules for geometric reasoning is therefore developed to generate feature sequence. The developed approach has been implemented as the Sequence Generator module in a Distributed Process Planning system and is validated through a case study.</abstract>

<abstract>Production management systems must constantly deal with unplanned disruptive events and disturbances such as arrivals of rush orders, raw material shortage/delays or equipment breakdowns along with a multitude of interactions in the supply chain which constantly demand on-line task rescheduling and order execution control. For responsiveness and agility at the shop-floor, a distributed design for manufacturing execution systems is proposed based on autonomic units that fill the gap between production planning and shop-floor control. An interaction mechanism designed around the concept of order and resource agents implementing the monitor-analyze-plan-execution loop is described. Generative simulation modeling of an autonomic manufacturing execution system (@MES) is proposed in order to evaluate emerging behaviors and macroscopic dynamics in a multiproduct batch plant. Results obtained for an industrial case study using a simulation model of the proposed @MES are presented. The usefulness of agent-based modeling and simulation as a tool for distributed MESs design and to verify performance, stability and disturbance rejection capability of an interaction mechanism is highlighted.</abstract>

<abstract>The performance of a rapid prototyping technology depends, to a great extent, on the way parts are oriented and packed on the machine's build platform. The present work focuses on stereolithography systems. It describes a pre-processing methodology that ‘automates’ the procedure of finding ‘good’ fabrication orientations and packing arrangements. The method proposed consists of two separate, but interrelated, stages: the orientation and the packing stage. At first, each part is appropriately oriented to achieve better surface quality and either minimal support structure or lower build time or minimal projection area. The second stage considers the projections of the parts on the fabrication platform. The associated 2D bin-packing problem is addressed by a genetic algorithm in conjunction with a new improved placement rule. The performance of the present approach is demonstrated via two sets of case studies, which concern simple nearly orthogonal-shaped parts and representative ‘real-world’ objects/parts.</abstract>

<abstract>While the financial indicators and reporting tools are the core instruments used for enterprise survival, the instruments for intellectual capital monitoring assist in defining the enterprise competitive advantages and strategic planning. Given the current market situation and global competition, an emerging crucial issue for the management team of a modern enterprise is to keep track of non-financial and non-physical resources demanded for successful realization of the business processes. Possible solution might be a corporate memory, which guides the enterprise in its intellectual capital acquisition, measurement, monitoring and management. The subject of this article is an ontology as a tool for knowledge representation within the corporate memory. The prototype of the corporate memory is in the testing stage. The test bed is a small chocolate factory.</abstract>

<abstract>Building on the similarities between software programs and workflow processes, this paper proposes a heuristic that offers guidance for the creation and evaluation of process designs in administrative settings. Designers can use this heuristic to select from several alternatives the process design that is strongly cohesive and weakly coupled. It is argued that such a design will result in fewer errors during information exchanges and in more understandable activity descriptions. The paper includes an application of the heuristic in an industrial workflow setting, which supports its feasibility and practical value. The paper also presents the freely available CoCoFlow tool that implements the heuristic and its associated metrics.</abstract>

<title>IPM-EPDL: an XML-based executable process definition language.</title>
<pages>85-104</pages>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>The capability to quickly design and deploy a new business process has become critical for companies to succeed in the rapidly changing global market. Web services are considered to be the most promising technology that enables automatic execution of business processes. It has some limitations, however, such as lack support for organizational structure and role model, customized user interface, access authorization of data, and storing instance data. This paper introduces Integrated Process Management Executable Process Definition Language (IPM-EPDL), an XML-based executable process definition language. IPM-EPDL supports flexible specification of organizational structure and role model. It allows the user to design the interface of a business process activity according to the number of users as well as their preferences, browser type, and type of the form to be used for the activity. It also enables to specify the access authorization of data and to check the validity of the data. Finally, it can specify all business data and keep it throughout the entire process lifecycle. Such data can be used for checking the status of process instance and for various analyses. The paper discusses how a typical process definition must be extended to enable its execution while providing the above advantages. The paper describes how the IPM-EPDL execution engine provides these capabilities. The paper also demonstrates a prototype system along with an extended example to illustrate that the proposed language and process execution engine can support rapid deployment of a new business process that can be performed on various platforms even by a remote user.</abstract>

<abstract>During the production of new part in an industrial environment, it results in a high percentage of scrap if manufacturing planning is not carried out properly. One of the major factors responsible for this phenomenon is tolerance synthesis. In this paper, we deal with tolerance synthesis, and especially tolerance type identified after transfer. An algorithmic Rational method for 3D Manufacturing Tolerancing Synthesis (R3DMTSyn), which is based on the use of the Technologically and Topologically Related Surface (TTRS) rules, is developed. The TTRS concept helps to generate only the necessary manufacturing specification needed to guarantee the respect of the functional specification studied.</abstract>

<abstract>The principles of Lean Production have enabled organisations in the manufacturing and service sectors to significantly improve their competitiveness. The application of Lean principles, derived from the Toyota Production System has enabled many organisations to simultaneously improve productivity, quality and customer service. Similar benefits have been achieved through the application of information technology (IT). The application of IT and Lean principles are claimed to be interdependent and complimentary by some; whilst others have seen as the approaches as being mutually exclusive.</abstract>

<title>An application to support the temporal and spatial distributed decision-making process in supply chain collaborative planning.</title>

<abstract>In the context of supply chains operations planning, mathematical programming models have been mainly used for centralised decision-making. However, the supply chain (SC) members not always agree on the alignment of individual decisions to SC-wide objectives and are usually reluctant to share all the required SC-wide information. For these reasons, SC decentralised decision making, in which different decisional units have to be coordinated to achieve a certain level of SC performance, is the most usual situation. In this collaborative planning (CP) context, spatial and temporal integration among the different SC decisional parts has to be considered. This paper aims to develop an application which supports the integrated modelling and execution of the CP decision-making process in SCs made up of several decisional centres (DCs) which make decisions based on mathematical programming models (as in Advanced Planning Systems) under temporal and spatial integration. The described application has been used to assist the CP of a real ceramic SC. The results are also reported.</abstract>

<title>An online ergonomic evaluator for 3D product design.</title>
<pages>479-492</pages>

<volume>56</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>5</number>
<abstract>This paper presents an online ergonomic evaluation system for 3D product development with car interior design as an example, which consists of a 3D viewer, a digital human model, an ergonomic engine, and the web-based GUI's. The digital human is constructed with a number of templates based on anthropometry database that represent various levels of body size and shape for the end-user. The interactions between the human and a product model are captured by the viewer, and thus, simulate the user operation of the product. According to the Chaffin's biomechanical model, the ergonomic engine then computes the physical loads of body joints with the captured information. The result enables online evaluation of the product design from the ergonomic aspects. It also serves as a base of interactive product customization. This research is the first study that realizes the web-based ergonomic evaluation for 3D car interior design with no needs of high-end CAD systems or complex VR environment. In this manner, the human factor issues can be effectively taken into account at the early design phase and the costs of ergonomic evaluation will be significantly reduced.</abstract>

<volume>58</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>Polyline curves which are composed of line segments and arcs are widely used in engineering applications. In this paper, a novel offset algorithm for polyline curves is proposed. The offset algorithm comprises three steps. Firstly, the offsets of all the segments of polyline curves are calculated. Then all the offsets are trimmed or joined to build polyline curves that are called untrimmed offset curves. Finally, a clipping algorithm is applied to the untrimmed offset curves to yield the final results. The offset algorithm can deal with polyline curves that are self-intersection, overlapping or containing small arcs. The new algorithm has been implemented in a commercial system TiOpenCAD 8.0 and its reliability is verified by a great number of examples.</abstract>

<abstract>In today's highly competitive global economy enterprise integration (EI) can take a major role in performance improvement. The more the scope of EI is enlarged, the more users, which are not integration experts, are involved. This fact generates communication problems. For the information system (IS), which remains the main integration vehicle, the situation is obviously similar. In this paper, it is proposed to analyse how an IS design approach, based on a key-problem framework, enables both to involve efficiently users and improve the design of a model of an integrated enterprise. These two points are developed through a cross-analysis of the works related to EI in both the enterprise modelling and information system design fields. They are then discussed and illustrated on a real case of integration of customer support, maintenance and design processes in a SME company that manufactures salt spreader components for snow clearing vehicles.</abstract>

<abstract>The paradigm change that rules our industry (currently evolving under the quality paradigm) requires an enterprise to organize innovation in a pragmatic way. Beyond theoretical discourses around the necessity for innovation, methods and tools, based on theories should now be translated into engineering practices to be efficiently applied. One of the consequences of this necessary evolution is that R&D departments (and especially project teams), familiar with methods and tools inherited from quality area, are pushed toward changes in their practices sometimes far from their respective cultures. Software tools for accompanying this evolution are needed. This article proposes the use of ontologies as a base to the development of those software tools. Formalization of the main concepts concerning inventive design is provided by the use of formal ontologies. The tools already developed assist the expert in the conduction of an inventive design study, from problem formulation to the proposal of solution concepts.</abstract>

<abstract>RP service bureaus or providers constantly face urgent requirements for price and delivery quotations on complicated RP parts. They are challenged to respond quickly and accurately with bids that are tailored to each customer's specifications. In order to satisfy the current quotation requirements of RP service bureaus and providers, this paper investigates and develops a web-based automated quotation system which can provide instant price quotations for stereolithography (SL) parts. Two quoting approaches which include the rough quotation based on weight and precise quotation based on build-time were proposed to determine the price quotation for SL parts. Furthermore, a Java-enabled solution together with web techniques was employed to develop the on-line price quotation system. Implementation of precise quotation method, as a typical module, was used to demonstrate the development of the system. The system offers a new choice for RP customers to allow them to quote instantly and compare multiple rapid prototyping processes.</abstract>

<abstract>As stronger supplier might exert their power to influence a product development project for their own benefit, business negotiations will be more efficient if the customer has a clear understanding of its power with regards to each of its potential suppliers. This article takes the customer perspective in dealing with supplier selection and proposes a method to estimate the power of a customer versus potential suppliers. Based on an evaluation of their power, potential suppliers are then ranked. This selection procedure is illustrated with an example and evaluated against a case study taken from academic literature.</abstract>

<abstract>This study introduces the research issues on closed-loop product lifecycle management (PLM) where product information flow is closed due to emerging technologies. PLM is a new strategic approach to manage the product lifecycle information efficiently over the whole product lifecycle. Recently, with emerging technologies, PLM enables us to gather and analyze the product lifecycle information and make decisions on several issues without spatial and temporal constraints. However, the PLM system just provides us with new opportunities to gain the competitiveness. To remove ineffectiveness within the product lifecycle and maximize the advantage of closed-loop PLM, it is necessary to look into new challenging issues. For this purpose, first, we introduce the concept of closed-loop PLM. Then, we explore several research problems that become highlighted in the closed-loop PLM. For each product lifecycle phase, we introduce research issues with the review of their previous research and address the requirements for resolving them. Finally, we close with discussion about our work and introduction of further research issues.</abstract>

<abstract>Modern microscopic volumetric imaging processes lack capturing flexibility and are inconvenient to operate. Additionally, the quality of acquired data could not be assessed immediately during imaging due to the lack of a coherent real-time visualization system. Thus, to eliminate the requisition of close user supervision while providing real-time 3D visualization alongside imaging, we propose and describe an innovative approach to integrate imaging and visualization into a single pipeline called an online incrementally accumulated rendering system. This system is composed of an electronic controller for progressive acquisition, a memory allocator for memory isolation, an efficient memory organization scheme, a compositing scheme to render accumulated datasets, and accumulative frame buffers for displaying non-conflicting outputs. We implement this design using a laser scanning confocal endomicroscope, interfaced with an FPGA prototyping board through a custom hardware circuit. Empirical results from practical implementations deployed in a cancer research center are presented in this paper.</abstract>

<title>Advanced optimal tolerance design of mechanical assemblies with interrelated dimension chains and process precision limits.</title>

<abstract>Tolerance design is an important step in product development. The topic has been under extensive research, which has resulted in several formulations and solution algorithms for systematic tolerance design considering various aspects. An optimal tolerance design problem involving alternative manufacturing processes for realization of a dimension can be referred to as the advanced tolerance design problem, where the optimal selection of a set of manufacturing processes is also considered in addition to the optimal set of tolerances. Such a nonlinear multivariate optimal tolerance design problem results in a non-convex combinatorial solution surface. Optimal solution of the advanced tolerance design problem is difficult with the traditional optimization techniques. The problem becomes more complex with the assemblies involving interrelated dimension chains, and manufacturing processes bracketed by precision bounds. The focus of this work is on the optimal solution of the aforementioned advanced tolerance design problem. Genetic algorithm, a non-traditional global optimization technique has been proposed as the solution methodology for its inherent advantages. Application of the methodology has been demonstrated with the help of suitable examples. Concept of the set up reduction constraints has also been introduced, wherein all the similar dimensions on a single part are manufactured on a single machine, resulting in a single value of design tolerance associated to all such dimensions.</abstract>

<abstract>The increasing competition and complexity of products and processes require new organizational concepts for product development. Collaborative design deals with the sharing of various interests and resources among various actors with the aim of reaching a common purpose. This purpose relies on the development of products using knowledge sharing and interactions with some coordination between these varied activities. The research objective is to provide a collaborative design environment which allows inter-skill collaboration to be coordinated by defining a common repository for knowledge management in a collaborative design situation. This paper will focus on the particular situation of conflict management. From a domain analysis of conflict management process, the first elements of a repository are given by identifying involved knowledge (static view) and formalizing protocols driven by actors to resolve conflicts (dynamic view).</abstract>

<abstract>In an array of problem solving methods, one can traditionally distinguish two kinds of problems: one is a problem that has solutions in a search space and the other is a problem that does not have solutions in a given space. The later problem so called solutionless problem or inventive problem requires an inventive approach to reformulate the problem and dialectical thinking brings benefits in the process. The framework used to formulate problems in a dialectical approach is contradiction. Identification of contradictions plays an important role in distinguishing solutionless problems: a contradiction exists when no solution can be found, and a solution exists when no contradiction can be found. In this article, the inadequacy of existing frameworks in satisfying this requirement is demonstrated and a framework that fits this requirement is proposed.</abstract>

<title>Fast dimensional inspection of deformable parts from partial views.</title>

<abstract>One of the conventional ways to inspect deformable parts is to compare a data model against its nominal CAD model. This process assumes that the data model includes most of the visible surface including regions around fixation points where the part will be attached to others. This paper proposes a method to inspect deformable part by acquiring only regions that need to be inspected and then by applying to the CAD model a non-linear deformation using FEM modeling to minimize the differences with the partial views. The process first starts with a rigid alignment followed by an iterative process where the part's deformation is iteratively matched to the partial views. In this scheme, fixation points are not digitized and the non-linear part deformation calculations are estimated by interpolation. Test results performed on real parts compares favorably to deformation calculations using complete data model from the point-of-view of speed and accuracy.</abstract>

<abstract>The multiple reconfiguration and the complexity of the modern production system lead to design intelligent monitoring aid systems. Accordingly, the use of neuro-fuzzy technics seems very promising. In this paper, we propose a new monitoring aid system composed by a dynamic neural network detection tool and a neuro-fuzzy diagnosis tool. Learning capabilities due to the neural structure permit us to update the monitoring aid system. The neuro-fuzzy network provides an abductive diagnosis. Moreover it takes into account the uncertainties on the maintenance knowledge by giving a fuzzy characterization of each cause. At the end, we illustrate the industrial usefulness of the proposed dynamic neuro-fuzzy monitoring system trough a flexible production system monitoring application.</abstract>

<abstract>Companies are moving towards quickly providing better customer-centric products and services improve market share and market size with continuously growing revenue. As such, the effective collaboration among customers, developers, suppliers, and manufacturers throughout the entire product lifecycle is becoming much more important for the most advanced competitiveness. To address this need, a framework for product lifecycle collaboration is proposed in this study. The details of these collaboration models throughout the entire product lifecycle are depicted. As one of the key elements in product lifecycle collaboration, technology to support collaborative product manufacturing is proposed, developed and implemented in this study. It is hoped that the developed technology for collaborative product manufacturing will lay a frontier basis for further research and development in product lifecycle management.</abstract>

<title>Data quality evaluation and improvement for prognostic modeling using visual assessment based data partitioning method.</title>

<volume>64</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>When developing Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) applications for manufacturing systems, data acquired frequently comes with issues which hinder further data analysis. However, there is neither a clear definition of the data quality nor evaluation methods to quantify if acquired data is suitable for these prognostic modeling tasks such as failures detection, diagnosis and prediction. Especially, during health diagnosis modeling of engineering systems, based on data-driven method, acquired data is expected to contain clusters that can be used to differentiate multiple system health conditions. So in most cases, once data is acquired, people would like to intuitively believe that data is able to cluster into subgroups. However, this bias could lead to acceptance of false information in data. Furthermore, most of the existing metrics, such as clustering tendency in statistics and cluster-ability in data mining, only individually evaluate data characteristics without considering prognostic modeling. This paper proposes a new method to evaluate and improve data quality for system health diagnosis modeling. The clusters, as critical data characteristics for modeling multiple system conditions, are first estimated by “visualization” on the dissimilarity spectrum from spectral analysis and then evaluated in terms of their fitness and separation with each others. A visual assessment based outlier detection method is also proposed to recognize outliers from the data, which utilizes the graphic intermediate results from previous evaluation. Finally one group of bearing testing dataset acquired from real industrial applications is used to demonstrate how proposed methods are used to evaluate and improve the data quality.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents the role of image acquisition and analysis in the development of a new strategy for the calibration of measurements of fuel distribution in gasoline direct injection engines. Images are acquired from a motored experimental engine that features a quartz ring in its upper cylinder construction. A carefully chosen fuel analogue is labelled with a fluorescent tracer. Illumination of the gas charge in the cylinder with a powerful UV laser results in laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) that is observed with an intensified camera.</abstract>

<abstract>Product–Service Systems (PSS) and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) have so far been researched individually in different domains and as unrelated research theme. However, to guarantee the availability of the asset, which is a typical demand in some PSS contracts, it is fundamental for PSS providers to be able to properly manage the asset's lifetime variability in order to avoid unscheduled downtimes and contract penalties. This paper describes part of a research project to investigate how PHM can support more effective fulfilment of some PSS contracts. In particular, this paper aims to present a novel framework to link PHM and PSS using online simulation. The paper also presents a prototype of the online simulation model and three experimental cases comparing the outcomes of the online simulation model against those obtained from the traditional simulation model.</abstract>

<abstract>In this article the use of asset information standards for collaboration in the process industry is reviewed based on a survey of the literature and two case studies. The investigation shows that the process industry appears to have had only limited success in introducing such standards so far, despite significant efforts. Since information hand-over between asset life cycle phases is important, lack of information standardization suggests that collaboration costs are higher than necessary. Reported causes can be grouped into standard related causes (slow development of standards, stability, complexity, cost, quality/ontological problems), organization related causes (lack of direct financial incentives, organizational readiness, resistance to change) and business environment related causes (legal aspects, level of adoption, limited governmental enforcement and a lack of dominant actors in the process industry). It is also shown that initial local configuration of a standard may lead to successful acceptance of the standards, but may hinder later external use. The contribution of this article is insight into the use of asset information standards and the causes for lack of pervasiveness. This is necessary for improving the use of standards in collaboration in the process industry. The article concludes by suggesting future research directions.</abstract>

<title>Lessons learned - Review of LCAs for ICT products and services.</title>

<abstract>Application of information and communication technology (ICT) is often expected to result in decreased environmental impacts. Several studies have, however, also addressed the possibilities of negative impacts. It is therefore important to assess environmental impacts of ICT products and services. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool for assessing the potential impacts of a product or service over the whole life-cycle, i.e. from raw material acquisition to waste management via production and use phases. The aim of this paper is to review LCA studies of ICT products and services, including a few Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) studies. Many of the studies have considered consumer products, such as computers and TVs. Other consumer products, such as game consoles and TV peripherals, as well as business products, e.g. related to networks, are however more rarely assessed. Manufacturing and use phase have the highest impact in the life cycle. Use phase seems to be the predominant in energy consumption and global warming for some ICT products but for others, especially energy efficient, low weight products, manufacturing may dominate. Rapid technological development is stressed by several authors as a source of variability of results, impacting the production processes and suppliers as well as the content and energy performance of the actual devices. In the future, conducting LCA on ICT, the research community needs to consider the limitations found in the studies conducted so far. It encompasses, among others, the need to address a broad spectrum of environmental impacts, including human and ecotoxicological impacts; modeling actual e-waste management, covering informal management when relevant; and considering user behavior in a realistic way, accounting for rebound and other indirect effects.</abstract>

<abstract>A single information system cannot meet all the business requirements, and not all e-procurement systems for the procurement of indirect goods are equally suitable for supporting different business processes throughout their distinct phases. Companies need to adopt different e-procurement systems or business models in a hybrid and seamless manner. Existing literature addressing e-procurement systems or business models have focused on the indirect procurement at high-level granularities only or at a low-level granularity only, either within a single e-procurement system or without matching between procurement processes and different e-procurement systems. In this paper, we provide the matching between indirect procurement process and different e-procurement systems, at both the high-level and low-level activities, for identifying and articulating the areas where various e-procurement systems can be utilized in a hybrid and seamless manner. The output of this paper can help companies adopt various e-procurement systems or business models and redesign their e-procurement processes.</abstract>

<title>Re-engineering the Engineering Change Management process for a drawing-less environment.</title>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>Currently, 3D models and 2D drawings are the main basic elements that together form and carry the product definition throughout the product lifecycle. With the advent of the Digital Product Definition trend, industries have been interested in adopting a Model-based Definition (MBD) approach that enables the integration of drawing annotations directly onto a 3D model, thereby minimizing the need to generate engineering drawings. This drawing-less environment requires a way to adequately carry the product definition throughout a product's lifecycle while supporting all of the downstream users’ specific needs. The objective of this article is to present a solution to carry the Engineering Change Management (ECM) process in a drawing-less environment. Therefore, based on ECM process requirements from two Canadian aerospace companies, we propose an MBD dataset which consists of an MBD model and a distribution file. The proposed MBD dataset is evaluated and the MBD-driven ECM process is outlined.</abstract>

<title>ADVICE: A virtual environment for Engineering Change Management.</title>

<abstract>In this paper, we analyze Engineering Changes (EC), which are modifications in forms, fits, functions, materials, or dimensions in components constituting the design. We propose a new approach for processing these changes within a Virtual Collaborative Design Environment. This environment, named Active Distributed Virtual Change Environment (ADVICE) offers an Engineering Change Management solution by merging graphical and parametric data involved in the process into a virtual platform, which improves the comprehension of users and hence decreases the time required for review. ADVICE provides smart user support for predicting Engineering Changes to be triggered due to a specific change and for offering priorities to Engineering Change Requests. This is managed by employing Sequential Pattern Mining techniques to process captured Engineering Change history with Prioritization and Change Propagation mechanisms. For verifying these mechanisms, experiments involving synthetic data are conducted. The experiments present the capability of ADVICE to facilitate Engineering Change Management.</abstract>

<abstract>The paper aims at presenting a Web-based product structure manager that enables designers to hold virtual meetings via Internet and that allows collaborative viewing, modification of product structure and annotation of the 3D model. This Web-based product structure manager provides a shared platform for the designers. Two concerns of designers of large systems are addressed in this application. First, heterogeneous application systems are used by designers and second, designers are geographically dispersed. In this context, STEP standard was found superior for data exchange among diverse CAD systems and the product structure manager has been developed as a “Web-based” application to achieve collaboration among designers. A case study has been carried out with this developed architecture for assembly modeling of a launch vehicle system called launcher hold and release system and its outcome is discussed in detail in this paper.</abstract>

<abstract>Ill-structured problems are difficult types to solve. When this type of problem is faced in an innovation pipeline, a technical obstacle emerges. Comparison between the definitions of ill-structured and inventive problems in theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) shows that the latter is a sub-set of the former in engineering. As a result, computer-aided innovation (CAI) systems (CAIs) based on TRIZ can be applied to solve some ill-structured problems that appear in an innovation pipeline. A model including two technical obstacles is developed for an innovation pipeline, and a case study is carried out to show how to eliminate the technical obstacles using the model.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents a literature review of the critical success factors (CSFs) in the implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) across 10 different countries/regions. The review covers journals, conference proceedings, doctoral dissertation, and textbooks from these 10 different countries/regions. Through a review of the literature, 18 CSFs were identified, with more than 80 sub-factors, for the successful implementation of ERP. The findings of our study reveal that ‘appropriate business and IT legacy systems’, ‘business plan/vision/goals/justification’, ‘business process reengineering’, ‘change management culture and programme’, ‘communication’, ‘ERP teamwork and composition’, ‘monitoring and evaluation of performance’, ‘project champion’, ‘project management’, ‘software/system development, testing and troubleshooting’, ‘top management support’, ‘data management’, ‘ERP strategy and implementation methodology’, ‘ERP vendor’, ‘organizational characteristics’, ‘fit between ERP and business/process’, ‘national culture’ and ‘country-related functional requirement’ were the commonly extracted factors across these 10 countries/regions. In these 18 CSFs, ‘top management support’ and ‘training and education’ were the most frequently cited as the critical factors to the successful implementation of ERP systems.</abstract>

<abstract>Semantic technologies that have arisen with web development have brought out new tools, concepts, and methodologies which are increasingly employed in Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) applications. This paper proposes a literature review of papers related to ontologies in the area of product lifecycle management. However, it only focuses on inference ontologies, i.e. ontologies that enable reasoning, for instance, models expressed in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). The goals of this paper are to explore the field of such applications, to figure out the advantages of inference ontologies in a PLM context and to synthesize major existing inference models in terms of methodology and structuration. Finally, this paper proposes several research perspectives.</abstract>

<abstract>The rapid and automated detection of manufacturing flaws is becoming increasingly important in order to maintain competitive advantage in many production environments. In the case of natural and ornamental materials, the presence of both surface colouration and surface topography is often such that manual inspection, along with many conventional imaging techniques, fails to isolate physical or structural defects in the presence of complex and random patterns. In this paper the concepts of photometric stereo are adapted and extended for application in manufacturing environments. A case study on the high speed inspection of ceramic tiles is presented for the analysis of surfaces at production line rates of up to 30 m/min. This new technique, for the first time, demonstrates a genuine and commercially attractive potential for the practical automated quality control of complex surfaces. A commercial system, based on this research, is currently being developed.</abstract>

<abstract>The evolution of enterprise services is changing the approach for enabling Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) and Supply Chain Management (SCM) business processes. Enabling systems are migrating to process- and service-oriented solutions. In particular, the paper demonstrates how the new technologies can be used to enable a critical process that links vehicle health maintenance to PLM. Our hypothesis is that Condition-based Maintenance (CBM) and PLM integration is achievable through composite application design. The key process for linking CBM to PLM must convert prognostic and diagnostic information into actionable information that can be directed into a project-level PLM environment that supports the end-to-end product improvement process. To test this hypothesis, we designed a composite application within the context of a Small Business Innovative Research project that is sponsored by the US government. This paper motivates the problem from the strategic level to the implementation level and describes the successful test of the hypothesis.</abstract>

<title>A fuzzy logic based system for risk analysis and evaluation within enterprise collaborations.</title>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>This paper addresses risk identification and assessment in network based enterprise collaborations, such as VOs or VEs, and proposes a fuzzy logic based system for risk analysis and evaluation. Risk factors are identified with respect to the four stages in a collaboration's life cycle: pre-creation, creation, operation and termination. A fuzzy logic based algorithm for collaboration risk evaluation is developed to assess these perceived risk factors. Each risk is described by a probability of risk and a risk impact. Both measures are specified in imprecise linguistic terms and modelled by fuzzy sets. Later the algorithm is embedded into a prototype web service, the Collaboration Risk Evaluator (CRE), implemented to identify risks, provide fuzzy risk assessment and facilitate control of the risk propagation in an enterprise collaboration. We have validated the CRE using test cases. Also, it is integrated in a real life online system supporting SMEs in the automotive industry.</abstract>

<abstract>Today, information systems (IS) occupy a prime position in our organisations. However, over 60% of IS projects represent a failure in terms of exceeding the budget, the deadlines and also in terms of unsatisfied requirements. Exceeding the deadlines in IS projects can be attributed, among others, to an inaccurate definition of the IS architecture during the preliminary study phase. The aim of this article is to suggest a reliable approach to working out a “preliminary” architecture. According to the state of the art, architecture design must combine an overall analysis of the IS and its reason for existing while guiding the choice of technological components. We develop, and illustrate with an industrial study-case, an approach to IS preliminary architecture design. It combines dialectic analysis as put forward in the OTSM-TRIZ theory [N. Khomenko, D. Kucharavy, OTSM-TRIZ problem solving process: solutions and their classification, in: Etria World Conference—TRIZ Future 2002, Strasbourg, France, 2002], and semiotics into a key-problem framework. Then, through a sequence of steps based on other OTSM-TRIZ principles, it proposes to exploit this framework and lead to a target architecture.</abstract>

<abstract>The global market is willing to improve their competitiveness through collaborative work and partnerships, motivating the companies to look for enhanced interoperability between computer systems and applications. However, the large number of system's heterogeneity and the company's lack of resources and know-show have been preventing organizations to move ahead in that direction. Today, the OMG's model-driven architecture (MDA) makes available an open approach to write specifications and develop applications, separating the application and business functionality from the platform technology. As well, the service-oriented architecture (SOA) establishes a software architectural concept that defines the use of services to support the requirements of software users, making them available as independent services accessible in a standardized way. Together, these two architectures seem to provide a suitable framework to improve company's competitiveness through the adoption of a standard-based extended environment, challenging and enhancing the interoperability between computer systems and applications in industry. The paper, after illustrating the general motivations the industrial SMEs have to adopt open architectures to achieve interoperability for extended and collaborative enterprise practices, presents the emerging model-driven and service-oriented architectures. Then, it describes an innovative case study in validation by the industry, proposing a standard-based extendable platform to support an interoperable environment through the adoption of MDA and SOA. The paper finishes with discussion and concluding remarks concerning the empirical results obtained from the pilot demonstrator.</abstract>

<abstract>Today, the enterprise must cooperate to survive in an increasingly competitive context. This co-operation is carried out by organisations in networks through the supply chain (SC). In order to do so, enterprises must be interoperable. In order to reach interoperability, the system must eradicate heterogeneity. This paper aims at presenting the problems of heterogeneity from two different points of view: semantic and organisational. In the first part, the paper exposes the problems of heterogeneity from the two points of view. This part insists on the weak alien problem resolution for the semantics. In the second part, the synchronisation and standardisation of practices of business processes are presented in order to solve a part of the problem of organisation heterogeneity. The third part presents the use of the performance measurement system to manage the evolution of the enterprises towards interoperability, i.e. the implementation and exploitation of the principles exposed previously. Then, the last part presents an application of the ECOGRAI method and implementation using a software tool in the frame of interoperability between manufacturing and maintenance companies.</abstract>

<title>Semantic search for matching user requests with profiled enterprises.</title>

<volume>64</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>Semantic search is an important approach that promises significant improvements for customers to identify products of their interest. To perform semantic search, enterprises need to publish semantically enriched descriptions of their offered goods and services; then a customer expresses his/her request, in an easy Google like fashion, by providing a list of desired features. If enterprise offerings and customer requests are based on the same vocabulary (i.e., ontology), they can be semantically matched by using advanced semantic methods. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based method aimed at finding the best matches between a user request and the services offered by different enterprises. We assume that in a given business ecosystem (in the paper, as an example, the tourism sector) a group of SMEs agree on the adoption of a reference ontology, used to build the company profiles on the basis of the offered services. Accordingly, a user request, represented by a set of desired features, is expressed in terms of the reference ontology terminology (i.e., concepts). In this paper, we illustrate SemSim, a method used to collectively search the SME profiles to identify the services that match at best the user request. SemSim is based on the well-known information content approach used to evaluate the semantic similarity between concepts. The experimental results show that our proposal performs better than some of the most representative similarity search methods proposed in the literature.</abstract>

<abstract>Purpose of this paper is to offer the reader an overview of recently performed and ongoing research related to process planning for sheet metal bending, thus providing a starting point for further exploration of this field. The scope of this review paper is limited to sheet metal bending as performed on numerically controlled press brakes, with special focus on air bending. Automatic process planning requires a good understanding of the material behaviour under process conditions. Therefore, some space has been reserved for an overview of bend modelling efforts and, directly linked to this, in-process measurement and adaptive control methods. Part representation and feature classification methods for bent sheet metal parts are also discussed. Sections are dedicated to the core problems of fully automated process planning in sheet metal bending: bend sequencing, collision detection, tolerance verification and tool selection. The state of the art review is completed with an overview of ergonomic analysis methods for process plan evaluation.</abstract>

<abstract>This study attempts to use a fuzzy expert system with gradient descent optimization for prediction of fabric specimens in fashion product development. Compared with the traditional methods used fabric mechanical properties to predict fabric specimens, our advisory system accepts fabric hand descriptors which are more closely related to the sensory judgments made by individuals during fabric selection. Fifty participants were selected to evaluate the performance of the proposed fuzzy fabric advisory system. They were asked to express their preferred fabric specimen on inputs of the 14 bipolar fabric hand descriptors in the system. The fuzzy prediction rules associated with the membership functions of each fabric specimen were developed from a survey. After fine-tuning of the proposed system, the prediction accuracy is over eighty percent. The outcomes of this study could help consumers to select the most appropriate fabric and provide field practitioners appropriate suggestions for effective product development in clothing and fashion industries.</abstract>

<abstract>The roles of customers from passive users to collaborators in creating and extracting business value have given rise to customer co-creation techniques and value co-creation models. Although these techniques and models have been useful to researchers and businesses, they are unstructured. A classification is necessary so that research can be placed in proper context of one another. Via an examination of the literature and based on the concept of customer value hierarchy a classification of the different models and techniques of co-creation is developed. There are two implications for the classification. Firstly, it will aid in the research and understanding of the use of the various techniques and models. Secondly, it can assist in designing appropriate encounter processes as a basis for engaging customers and subsequently provide innovation for organizations. The paper concludes with an application of the classification to develop encounter processes in a learning management system.</abstract>

<title>Integrated Vehicle Configuration System - Connecting the domains of mass customization.</title>
<pages>44-52</pages>

<volume>61</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>Configuration design for mass customized vehicles necessitates the coordination of customer requirements, product characteristics, production processes, and logistics networks, in order to achieve rapid response to customer orders. Existing product configurators are mainly used as sales tools, and fail to account for the requirements of the entire customer order fulfillment process. In this regard, this paper proposes an Integrated Vehicle Configuration System (IVCS) to facilitate customer order processing based on information from multiple domains in a mass customization environment. An IVCS business model is proposed to incorporate the decision factors for configuration design related to different planning stages. The business model is supported by a comprehensive ontology framework, which enhances communications between different stakeholders involved in the order fulfillment process. The configuration approach is based on combinations of selective and generative rules and can be integrated with existing ERP systems. It also provides mechanisms to handle configuration rules that allow users to convert soft preferences into product specifications, bill-of-materials, and, furthermore, into logistics configurations. An example of a computerized configuration system showcases the process from customer engineering to design and production.</abstract>

<title>Sales configurator capabilities to avoid the product variety paradox: Construct development and validation.</title>
<pages>436-447</pages>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>4</number>
<abstract>Sales configurators are applications designed to support potential customers in choosing, within a company's product offer, the product solution that best fits their needs. These applications can help firms avoid the risk that offering more product variety and customization in an attempt to increase sales, paradoxically results in a loss of sales. Relatively few studies, however, have focused on the characteristics sales configurators should have so as to avoid this paradox. Furthermore, empirical investigation on the effectiveness of the recommendations made by these studies has been hindered by the lack of psychometrically sound measurement items and scales. This paper conceptualizes, develops and validates five capabilities that sales configurators should deploy in order to avoid the product variety paradox: namely, focused navigation, flexible navigation, easy comparison, benefit-cost communication, and user-friendly product-space description capabilities. It is hoped that this study will provide a parsimonious measurement instrument to advance theory testing in the field. Moreover, this instrument may be a useful diagnostic and benchmarking tool for companies seeking to assess and/or improve sales configurators they use or develop.</abstract>

<title>Modeling the permeability of carbonate reservoir using type-2 fuzzy logic systems.</title>
<pages>147-163</pages>
<year>2011</year>
<volume>62</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>In this work, the use of type-2 fuzzy logic systems as a novel approach for predicting permeability from well logs has been investigated and implemented. Type-2 fuzzy logic system is good in handling uncertainties, including uncertainties in measurements and data used to calibrate the parameters. In the formulation used, the value of a membership function corresponding to a particular permeability value is no longer a crisp value; rather, it is associated with a range of values that can be characterized by a function that reflects the level of uncertainty. In this way, the model will be able to adequately account for all forms of uncertainties associated with predicting permeability from well log data, where uncertainties are very high and the need for stable results are highly desirable. Comparative studies have been carried out to compare the performance of the proposed type-2 fuzzy logic system framework with those earlier used methods, using five different industrial reservoir data. Empirical results from simulation show that type-2 fuzzy logic approach outperformed others in general and particularly in the area of stability and ability to handle data in uncertain situations, which are common characteristics of well logs data. Another unique advantage of the newly proposed model is its ability to generate, in addition to the normal target forecast, prediction intervals as its by-products without extra computational cost.</abstract>

<abstract>In this article we introduce a novel approach and tool for fact-oriented business semantics management that is inspired by agile design methods. We demonstrate and validate it in a realistic case study that was carried out within the European Codrive project. Codrive's vision was to contribute to more meaningful competency-centric human resource management. Key challenges are the uniform publication of unambiguous competency information and “time-to-competency” agility. To this end, we developed a shared and formal knowledge representation of competency domains. Stakeholders include educational institutes, public employment organisations, and industry partners from different European countries. The resulting Vocational Competency Ontology wanted to provide a candidate best practice for engineering a community-shared and reusable Semantic Pattern Base that can be applied by all stakeholders to semantically reconcile their contextualised competency models.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents an effective way of modeling complex systems through identified functioning modes. In the proposed approach, the integration of monitoring in the manufacturing system is facilitated by the development of a generic model. The aim is to propose a monitoring system able of absorbing internal degradation of any variables and ensuring the continuity of the service. The outline of the optimization of the fault latency method is based on two steps is proposed. The first step is the evaluation of fault latency and the second one is the performance evaluation of monitoring process. Timed automata are the modeling tool used for these two steps. The proposed method can be applied to various kinds of processes and gives good results. Indeed, the simulation results, including a serial manufacturing line, substantiate the feasibility of the proposed method and provide a promising potential to spin-off applications in industrial manufacturing system.</abstract>

<abstract>Collaborative product design (CPD) is a knowledge-intensive process that encompasses conceptual design, detailed design, engineering analysis, assembly design, process design, and performance evaluation. Each task involves various areas of knowledge and experience. However, successful collaborative product design depends on the ability to effectively manage and share engineering knowledge and experience throughout the entire development process. Consequently, the realization of distributed engineering knowledge management, which not only supports collaborative product design but also accumulates and utilizes corporate memory situated at various locations, has become one of the key tasks managed by industries.</abstract>

<title>A novel fuzzy multi-criteria decision framework for sustainable supplier selection with incomplete information.</title>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>Both academic and corporate interest in sustainable supply chains has increased in recent years. Supplier selection process is one of the key operational tasks for sustainable supply chain management. This paper examines the problem of identifying an effective model based on sustainability principles for supplier selection operations in supply chains. Due to its multi-criteria nature, the sustainable supplier evaluation process requires an appropriate multi-criteria analysis and solution approach. The approach should also consider that decision makers might face situations such as time pressure, lack of expertise in related issue, etc., during the evaluation process. The paper develops a novel approach based on fuzzy analytic network process within multi-person decision-making schema under incomplete preference relations. The method not only makes sufficient evaluations using the provided preference information, but also maintains the consistency level of the evaluations. Finally, the paper analyzes the sustainability of a number of suppliers in a real-life problem to demonstrate the validity of the proposed evaluation model.</abstract>

<title>Using SVM based method for equipment fault detection in a thermal power plant.</title>
<pages>42-50</pages>

<volume>62</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>Due to the growing demand on electricity, how to improve the efficiency of equipment in a thermal power plant has become one of the critical issues. Reports indicate that efficiency and availability are heavily dependant upon high reliability and maintainability. Recently, the concept of e-maintenance has been introduced to reduce the cost of maintenance. In e-maintenance systems, the intelligent fault detection system plays a crucial role for identifying failures. Data mining techniques are at the core of such intelligent systems and can greatly influence their performance. Applying these techniques to fault detection makes it possible to shorten shutdown maintenance and thus increase the capacity utilization rates of equipment. Therefore, this work proposes a support vector machines (SVM) based model which integrates a dimension reduction scheme to analyze the failures of turbines in thermal power facilities. Finally, a real case from a thermal power plant is provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SVM based model. Experimental results show that SVM outperforms linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and back-propagation neural networks (BPN) in classification performance.</abstract>

<abstract>In order to process the growing quantities of used electronics, efficient demanufacturing methods are needed. The industry utilizes manual methods for dismantling products. A demanufacturing projector–vision system is proposed to create a more efficient demanufacturing work cell that combines manual and automated processing methods. To facilitate the demanufacturing process, the projection–vision system identifies the used products, displays real time product dispositions to the operator, displays tailored work instructions for the operator, and identifies the product surface for robotic processing. A prototype of the work cell was implemented. The system facilitates proper processing of used goods to meet current product or material demand. The projector–vision-based system was integrated into an existing modeling framework for robotic processing. The application of projector–vision technology improves the accuracy of recovered material databases, improves the integrity of used material streams, and helps maintain accurate demanufacturing process plan information.</abstract>

<title>A system for rapid creation and assessment of conceptual large vehicle designs using immersive virtual reality.</title>

<abstract>Currently, new product concepts are often evaluated by developing detailed virtual part and assembly models with traditional computer aided design (CAD) tools followed by appropriate analyses (e.g., finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, etc.). The creation of these models and analyses are tremendously time consuming. If a number of different conceptual configurations have been determined, it may not be possible to model and analyze each of them due to the complexity of these evaluation processes. Thus, promising concepts might be eliminated based solely on insufficient time and resources for assessment. In addition, the virtual models and analyses performed are usually of much higher detail and accuracy than what is needed for such early assessment. By eliminating the time-consuming complexity of a CAD environment and incorporating qualitative assessment tools, engineers could spend more time evaluating concepts that may have been previously abandoned due to time constraints. To address these issues, the Advanced Systems Design Suite (ASDS), was created. The ASDS incorporates a PC user interface with an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment to ease the creation and assessment of conceptual design prototypes individually or collaboratively in an immersive VR environment. Assessment tools incorporate metamodeling approximations and immersive visualization to evaluate the feasibility of each concept. In this paper, the ASDS system and interface along with specifically designed immersive VR assessment tools such as state saving and dynamic viewpoint creation are presented for conceptual large vehicle design. A test case example of redesigning an airplane is presented to explore the feasibility of the proposed system.</abstract>

<abstract>The ever increasing Internet bandwidth and the fast changing needs of businesses for effectiveness with the partners in the procurement chain and is leading organizations to adopt information systems infrastructures that are cost effective as well as flexible. The question seems to be: what is driving organizations to go in for Software as a Service (SaaS) based e-procurement and ERP, rather than the packaged model of software provisioning? Whereas there have been studies reporting technology, cost, quality, network externalities and process as the main variables in the utility function of the user, but most of the studies have modelled either one or two in the their models. The study is exploratory in nature and tries to identify, classify and rank dimensions affecting SaaS sourcing decisions. In this study, we developed an integrative framework to identify the determinants of choice of SaaS in the specific context of SaaS based e-procurement and ERP. The framework was then analyzed using the extended Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method suggested by Liberatore (1987) and the relative importance and the weights of the criteria identified using data collected on 8 users and 9 service providers of SaaS based e-procurement and ERP. Although the analysis helped in identifying quality and costs as the two most important determinants of choice of SaaS based e-procurement and ERP, but the other criteria such as network externality benefits, technology and process were also found to be significant determinants of choice.</abstract>

<title>SIS-Stamp: An integrated inspection system for sheet prints in stamp printing application.</title>

<number>8-9</number>
<abstract>Postal stamps with print defects are valuable collectables for philatelists. However, stamp printers strive to emit exclusively defect-free stamps. In order to achieve high quality of the production process, each sheet is inspected by especially trained staff. This kind of inspection is very flexible but it is tedious and leads to unstable and irreproducible results. Based on the experience in quality inspection, the ARC Seibersdorf Research Team set the goal to design an automated sheet inspection system (SIS), in which the front and rear side of the sheet are quality-inspected in a fully automatic mode using image processing methods. The print inspection covers each single stamp in the sheet and includes, among others, misalignments of the individual print phases and the perforation, detecting defects like smears, splashes and missing parts of the print. The features to be inspected, as well as the defect sensitivity, can be defined by a special setup program. The patented mechanical sheet transportation system separates the sheets, transports them to the inspection stations, and finally, stacks them in two trays for good and defective sheets. The prototype of the SIS-Stamp is installed in the Austrian State Printing Office (Österreichische Staatsdruckerei, ÖSD) for final inspection of postal stamps and vouchers.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper we present a 3D-vision based obstacle detection system for an autonomously operating train in open terrain environments. The system produces dense depth data in real-time from a stereo camera system with a baseline of 1.4 m to fulfill accuracy requirements for reliable obstacle detection 80 m ahead. On an existing high speed stereo engine, several modifications have been applied to significantly improve the overall performance of the system. Hierarchical stereo matching and slanted correlation masks increased the quality of the depth data in a way that the obstacle detection rate increased from 89.4% to 97.75% while the false positive detection rate could be kept as low as 0.25%. The evaluation results have been obtained from extensive real-world test data. An additional stereo matching speed-up of factor 2.15 was achieved and the overall latency of obstacle detection is considerably faster than 300 ms.</abstract>

<abstract>Nowadays, Internet technologies and standards are being systematically used by enterprises as tools to provide an infrastructure to connect people, enterprises, and applications they are using. In such complex networked enterprises, it is increasingly challenging to interchange, share, and manage internal and external digital information. In this context, to achieve interoperability between information systems is a challenging task. In order to solve the interoperability problem at semantic level, several ontology-based approaches have emerged. Although methodologies, methods, techniques, and tools to support the ontology building process were proposed, there are no mature models to measure this process, and the quality of implemented ontologies remains a major concern. This paper presents a framework, OntoQualitas, for evaluating the quality of an ontology whose purpose is the information interchange between different contexts. OntoQualitas includes previous and new measures to evaluate the ontology considering its specific purpose. Additionally, an empirical validation of OntoQualitas is presented.</abstract>

<title>Reactive, model-based monitoring in RFID-enabled manufacturing.</title>

<abstract>Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is widely applied throughout the manufacturing lifecycle to track important objects. It is imperative to establish a reactive monitoring system to convert large volumes of RFID data into meaningful information. Two major challenges must therefore be addressed: modeling complexity and monitoring efficiency. When the relationship between high-level “untagged” elements (business processes, indicators) and low-level “tagged” elements (persons, objects) becomes intricate, it will become difficult to define, maintain and reason by only using traditional rule-based event processing approaches. In order to resolve this problem, the paper proposes a reactive, model-based approach to monitor important elements by estimating their most likely states according to RFID information and a constraint-based model. The approach contains two phases. (1) The model-based programming phase formalizes RFID information and flexibly embeds them into the model that specifies the monitoring rules. (2) The model-based monitoring phase interprets the model and estimates desired states efficiently. Therefore, the RFID-enabled manufacturing units are capable of responding in a timely manner to unexpected disturbances or other important issues.</abstract>

<abstract>The work aims at thinking over a concept of spare parts manufacturing on request and in a short time. This concept will concern ‘isolated systems’ in which the part supplying is made difficult because of the specific environment which is not really adapted and for which the storage of spare parts implies space constraints incompatible with the size of such systems. The quick spare parts manufacturing is made possible by developing new quick manufacturing technologies about to be mature today and using e-maintenance supports. The implementation of those technologies allows reproducing the defective unit, which needs to be replaced in a short time and according to the requirements.</abstract>

<abstract>Full realization of all the potentials of predictive maintenance highly depends on the accuracy of long-term predictions of the remaining useful life of manufacturing equipments. In this paper, we propose a new method that is capable of achieving high long-term prediction accuracy by comparing signatures from any two degradation processes using measures of similarity that form a match matrix (MM). Through this concept, we can effectively include large amounts of historical information into the prediction of the current degradation process. Similarities with historical records are used to generate possible future distributions of features indicative of process performance, which are then used to predict the probabilities of failure over time by evaluating overlaps between predicted feature distributions and feature distributions related to unacceptable equipment behavior. The analysis of experimental results shows that the proposed method can yield a noticeable improvement of long-term prediction accuracy in terms of mean prediction errors over the Elman Recurrent Neural Network (ERNN) based prediction, which was shown in the past literature to predict well behavior of highly non-linear and non-stationary time series.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper describes a generic concept of how to combine the experience of user centred design (UCD) in the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) with the traditional approach of participatory design (PD) in an architectural design process. Even if some basic requirements of this generic method are not available yet, this paper will also describe an approach, which enables planners even now to involve end users by using virtual environments (VE) as immersive and spatial prototype. It will be described and illustrated by the way of example using the building project Centre of Virtual Engineering of the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering (IAO) in Stuttgart. It demonstrates that the transfer of the UCD approach to architectural planning combined with the provision of an adequate prototype can make a significant contribution towards an increase in quality and performance in building and construction projects.</abstract>

<abstract>By relying on business intelligence technologies, services can be delivered to customers automatically by computer systems. To provide the right services to the right person, a methodology that precisely identifies a personal's identity must be in place. Biometrics offers a secure and reliable method for computerized personal identification and authentication. It accurately recognizes and determines the unique identity of a person based on her physiological and/or behavioral characteristics. In the case of physical objects, they may also be required to be identified automatically in order to provide additional services, such as at checkout counters of supermarkets or customs clearance checkpoints. Numerous crimes and business losses (e.g. counterfeit products) are related to mis-identification of physical objects. This paper introduces physimetric identification, an approach that applies the concept of biometrics for physical object identification. It addresses the problem through authenticating physical objects based on their unique physical and/or chemical characteristics. Apart from introducing the concept of physimetric identification, issues such as real applications, deployment considerations and limitations of the proposed technology will also be discussed.</abstract>

<title>Towards dynamic reference information models: Readiness for ICT mass customisation.</title>

<volume>61</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>Current dynamic demand-driven networks make great demands on, in particular, the interoperability and agility of information systems. This paper investigates how reference information models can be used to meet these demands by enhancing ICT mass customisation. It was found that reference models for Production and Supply Chain Management do not yet sufficiently meet the requirements of a mass customisation approach. They have developed from isolated models based on pure standardisation and tailored customisation strategies, towards static repository-based models founded on segmented standardisation strategies. Existing models provide valuable knowledge for developing towards more dynamic reference information models, including the progress made by ERP vendors to make their reference models configurable. Important remaining challenges are setting up reference information models as generic models that define classes of architectures, and incorporating user-friendly means that guide users through the process of configuring specific information models.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper discusses shortfalls in relation to the requirements gathering phases of simulation. While many developments have taken place around supporting the model coding task of simulation, there are few tools available to assist in the requirements gathering phase. This is surprising as it has been reported by several researchers that the requirements phase can absorb twice as much resources as the coding phase. There are numerous process modeling tools available (over 100) that can and have been used to support the requirements phase of simulation. This paper provides a selective review of some of the most important in relation to simulation. A conclusion from this review is that none of the tools available adequately supports the requirements gathering phase of simulation. It is proposed that a process modeling tool be developed specifically to support simulation requirements gathering. The design objectives in the development of the tool are: (1) it should be capable of capturing a detailed description of a discrete event system; (2) it should have a low modeling burden and therefore be capable of being used by non-specialists; (3) it should present modeling information at a high semantic level so that manufacturing personnel can rationalize with it; (4) it should have good visualization capabilities; (5) it should support project teamwork. Based on these design objectives a proposed simulation process modeling tool called simulation activity diagrams (SAD) is presented.</abstract>

<title>Hybrid genetic algorithm with adaptive abilities for resource-constrained multiple project scheduling.</title>

<abstract>In this paper, we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm with fuzzy logic controller (flc-hGA) to solve the resource-constrained multiple project scheduling problem (rc-mPSP) which is well known NP-hard problem. Objectives described in this paper are to minimize total project time and to minimize total tardiness penalty. However, it is difficult to treat the rc-mPSP problems with traditional optimization techniques. The proposed new approach is based on the design of genetic operators with fuzzy logic controller (FLC) through initializing the revised serial method which outperforms the non-preemptive scheduling with precedence and resources constraints. For these rc-mPSP problems, we demonstrate that the proposed flc-hGA yields better results than conventional genetic algorithms and adaptive genetic algorithm.</abstract>

<abstract>In many manufacturing processes, some key process parameters (i.e., system inputs) have very strong relationship with the categories (e.g., normal or various faulty products) of finished products (i.e., system outputs). The abnormal changes of these process parameters could result in various categories of faulty products. In this paper, a hybrid learning-based model is developed for on-line intelligent monitoring and diagnosis of the manufacturing processes. In the proposed model, a knowledge-based artificial neural network (KBANN) is developed for monitoring the manufacturing process and recognizing faulty quality categories of the products being produced. In addition, a genetic algorithm (GA)-based rule extraction approach named GARule is developed to discover the causal relationship between manufacturing parameters and product quality. These extracted rules are applied for diagnosis of the manufacturing process, provide guidelines on improving the product quality, and are used to construct KBANN. Therefore, the seamless integration of GARule and KBANN provides abnormal warnings, reveals assignable cause(s), and helps operators optimally set the process parameters. The proposed model is successfully applied to a japing-line, which improves the product quality and saves manufacturing cost.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents an ongoing project on the development of an e-Engineering framework proposed by KIMM (Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials). The framework aims to provide an integrated engineering environment to support collaborating and integrating personnel, design/modelling/simulation activities and engineering resources in the product development process. Integration of the distributed engineering resources and orchestration of engineering activities have been recognized as crucial issues to construct such collaborative engineering environments successfully. To effectively support integration and collaboration in the framework, the framework is built on the basis of a number of advanced technologies, such as service-oriented architecture, intelligent software agents, and Web services. Based on service-oriented architecture and Web services technologies, the framework is able to utilize and integrate effectively various engineering resources on the geographically distributed computing environments. And through intelligent agent technologies, it supports cooperation and coordination mechanisms for the engineering activities. In this paper we describe the implementation of the framework in detail. In addition, we present the applicability of the framework with a case study.</abstract>

<abstract>Existing work in process mining focuses on the discovery of the underlying process model from their instances. In this paper, we do not assume the existence of a single process model to which all process instances comply, and the goal is to discover a set of frequently occurring temporal patterns. Discovery of temporal patterns can be applied to various application domains to support crucial business decision-making. In this study, we formally defined the temporal pattern discovery problem, and developed and evaluated three different temporal pattern discovery algorithms, namely TP-Graph, TP-Itemset and TP-Sequence. Their relative performances are reported.</abstract>

<abstract>Automated feature recognition (AFR) has provided the greatest contribution to fully automated CAPP system development. The objective of this paper is to review various approaches for solving three major AFR problems: (i) extraction of geometric primitives from a CAD model; (ii) defining a suitable part representation for form feature identification; and (iii) feature pattern matching/recognition. A novel, detailed classification of developed AFR systems has been introduced. This paper also provides a thorough investigation of methods for geometric feature extraction, emphasizing STEP standard application and, finally, a review of recent research reports in the field of AFR with rule-based feature pattern recognition. We discuss potentials and limitations of these approaches and emphasize directions for further research work.</abstract>

<abstract>Business Process Management (BPM) acceptance requires a modeling framework in which all abstraction layers (from the high-level enterprise view to the low-level task view) are unified and kept consistent at all times. This paper presents a simple yet effective multi-layered multi-view business process modeling framework that integrates organizational aspects, behavioral aspects, and input and output of business processes. The ultimate goal of this framework is to structure modeling efforts and to improve the usability of business process models in day-to-day decision making. A set of relationships between the layers are defined to support round-tripping as much as possible. A financial services based example is presented as a proof-of-concept in which the modeling framework was tested and assessed.</abstract>

<abstract>Digital enterprise technologies combined with sophisticated optimization algorithms can significantly contribute to the efficiency of production. The paper introduces a novel approach for integrated production planning and control, with the description of the mathematical models and solution algorithms. The deterministic optimization algorithms are complemented by a discrete-event simulation system to assess solution robustness in case of disturbances. The methods are illustrated by describing two prototype systems and by some experimental results obtained in an industry-initiated project.</abstract>

<abstract>A fundamental challenge in any Business Process Redesign (BPR) project is to come up with a new process design that is in one or more ways superior to the existing plan. Based on earlier research, a framework to help the designer in selecting the proper best practice(s) for this purpose is presented and validated in this paper. It is described how the framework is used in generating improved process designs for two Dutch organisations. Furthermore, the results from a survey are presented, which has been carried out among BPR practitioners in the UK and the Netherlands to test the framework. The overall conclusion is that the framework is indeed helpful in supporting process redesign and that its core elements are recognised and put in practice by the BPR practitioner community. The framework, therefore, may be of direct interest to both academics and practitioners active in the process improvement field.</abstract>

<abstract>Concept selection is the most critical part of the design process as it determines the direction of subsequent design stages. In addition, it is a difficult task because available information for decision-making at this stage is imprecise and subjective. This necessitates the need for fuzzy decision models for selecting the best conceptual design among a set of alternatives. Although ordinary fuzzy sets cover uncertainties of linguistic words to some extent, it is recommended to use interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FS) to capture potential uncertainties of words. This paper presents a new concept selection methodology that extends the fuzzy information axiom (FIA) approach to incorporate IT2FSs. The proposed methodology is called interval-type-2 fuzzy information axiom (IT2-FIA). IT2-FIA method is also enriched by using ordered weighted geometric aggregation operator to include the decision maker's attitude during the aggregation process. A case study is given to demonstrate the potential of the methodology.</abstract>

<abstract>Researchers, practitioners and enterprise software providers are realising the potential of agent-based technology to automate supply chain procurement to achieve consistent, traceable decision making. As the complexity of supply chains grow, these systems will gain more attention. In this paper, we model and simulate a complex autonomous supply chain managed by computational agents that aim to minimise lead time and maximise revenue through evolutionary multi-objective optimisation. The agents are in a competitive environment where they take on the roles of both client and producer. In addition to optimising their production strategy, they also have the opportunity to dynamically fine-tune their decision parameters when it comes to selecting their own suppliers, using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. It is observed that computational agents are capable of functioning in such complex environments, effectively converging to policies in synergy with their market. Multi-objective, multi-role optimisation results in better overall supply chain performance than tests where agents have single-objectives and single-roles. Our study forms an exploratory step towards more realistic agent-based supply chains where analytical methods are unavailable.</abstract>

<title>Hardware approach to tool path computation for STEP-NC enabled CNC: A case study of turning operations.</title>

<volume>62</volume>

<number>5</number>
<abstract>Tool path generation is an important task that must be supported by the controller of a STEP-NC compliant CNC machine tool. However, these algorithms demand higher computation performance, which makes the implementation on many existing systems very slow or even impractical. This fact is one of the main barriers for the adoption of the STEP-NC standard for CNC machines. Hardware acceleration is an incremental solution that can be cleanly added to these systems while keeping everything else intact. It is completely transparent to the user. The cost is much lower and the development time is much shorter than replacing the computers by faster ones. The resulting system is much more robust. This paper presents a hardware solution for the implementation of a highly accurate and robust tool path generation algorithm, called virtual digitizing. This algorithm has multiple advantages when compared to traditional algorithms and can be applied to standard, as well as non-standard machining (retrofitting). We have run a series of experiments to explore the design space and show different hardware/software solutions, as well as the performance, cost and precision trade-offs. Our hardware has been implemented with Xilinx FPGAs and coded with a high level hardware description language (Handel-C). The execution time is two orders of magnitude faster than legacy CNC systems and one order of magnitude faster than modern PCs.</abstract>

<abstract>In the last decades significant changes in the manufacturing environment have been noticed: moving from a local economy towards a global economy, with markets asking for products with higher quality at lower costs, highly customised and with short life cycle. In these circumstances, the challenge is to develop manufacturing control systems with intelligence capabilities, fast adaptation to the environment changes and more robustness against the occurrence of disturbances. This paper presents an agile and adaptive manufacturing control architecture that addresses the need for the fast reaction to disturbances at the shop floor level, increasing the agility and flexibility of the enterprise, when it works in volatile environments. The proposed architecture introduces an adaptive control that balances dynamically between a more centralised structure and a more decentralised one, allowing combining the global production optimisation with agile reaction to unexpected disturbances.</abstract>

<abstract>Project Portfolio Management (PPM) has become increasingly important in managing multiple projects simultaneously. However, during execution, the project portfolio is associated with considerable uncertainty that leads to resource contention among projects and schedule disruptions. Regarding the need to revise a schedule when unexpected events occur, we adopt an event-driven approach to develop a tradeoff decision framework for project portfolio scheduling and rescheduling. In the framework, High Level Petri nets, Activity-Based Costing and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) are applied in sequence to generate feasible schedules, estimate their makespan and costs, and select the best compromise schedule. This framework is advantageous in the evaluation of scheduling performance from a multi-criteria perspective and the incorporation of both objective and subjective measurements in the decision process.</abstract>

<abstract>Recent years have seen an increased uptake of business process management technology in industries. This has resulted in organizations trying to manage large collections of business process models. One of the challenges facing these organizations concerns the retrieval of models from large business process model repositories. For example, in some cases new process models may be derived from existing models, thus finding these models and adapting them may be more effective and less error-prone than developing them from scratch. Since process model repositories may be large, query evaluation may be time consuming. Hence, we investigate the use of indexes to speed up this evaluation process. To make our approach more applicable, we consider the semantic similarity between labels. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our approach is efficient.</abstract>

<title>Developing a trust evaluation method between co-workers in virtual project team for enabling resource sharing and collaboration.</title>

<abstract>An increasing number of companies, especially those with knowledge-intensive R&D programs, have turned to virtual project teams (VPTs) in recent years to generate the greatest competitive advantage from limited labor and resources. Members of a VPT are not limited to an enterprise and usually have various core capabilities. Successful implementation of a VPT depends on collaboration among team members during a project; such collaboration relies on efficient management of distributed resources, safe and timely resource sharing, and reliable trust evaluation mechanisms that facilitate the greatest degree of information sharing and minimize information transfer delays. This study first identifies VPT characteristics and the particular requirements of effective resource management and sharing. A VPT model is then presented. By applying this model, this study presents a trust evaluation method that assists VPT members in determining whether resource holders have made appropriate decisions to share resources with other VPT members. The proposed evaluation method comprises a trust evaluation between two VPT workers and a reliability evaluation of worker. Each resource can have a threshold that is a benchmark for resource sharing. The trust evaluation method for the proposed VPT model enables secure resource sharing across team and enterprise boundaries, facilitates collaboration, and enhances information transparency among team members.</abstract>

<abstract>Process interconnection mechanisms are necessary to coordinate geographically distributed business processes in order to strength awareness inside virtual enterprises, to facilitate multinational e-transactions, etc. Actually, existing business process modelling and enactment systems (workflow systems, project management tools, shared agendas, to do lists, etc.) have been mainly developed to suit enterprise internal needs. Thus, most of these systems are not adapted to inter-enterprise cooperation. As we are interested in workflow processes, we aim, through this paper, to present a model supporting dynamic heterogeneous workflow process interconnection. We consider the interconnection of enterprise workflow processes as the management of a “workflow of workflows” in which several heterogeneous workflow systems coexist. This paper introduces our process interconnection model, its implementation, and its validation through experimentation.</abstract>

<title>Maintaining time and space consistencies in hybrid CAD environments: Framework and algorithms.</title>

<volume>59</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>Based on the analysis of two types of collaborations during engineering design, namely time collaboration and space collaboration, this paper introduces a Total Data Model (TDM) centered framework to support the maintenance of time and space consistencies in hybrid CAD environments. By separating data and view, the proposed framework supports view-wandering between different perspectives so that designers can adjust their behaviors to avoid conflicts. The maintenance of time consistency is achieved by utilizing the Address Space Transformation (AST) algorithm. In order to adapt AST to new large-scale design environments, an effective garbage collection strategy is proposed. As for space collaboration, a conflict detection algorithm based on feature face is introduced. A prototype system has been developed to prove the validity, efficiency, and feasibility of the proposed framework.</abstract>

<abstract>Services providers, such as public healthcare systems and government agencies, are under tremendous pressure to reduce costs and improve service quality. Scheduling is an important managerial component which has considerable impact on both the costs and quality of services. Service providers need customers’ availability information to improve resource utilization. On the other hand, customers may be of “two minds” about communicating their private information. While communicating certain amount of availability might be necessary in order to obtain preferred schedules, too much communication place a potential cost due to privacy loss. In this paper, we present a bidding-based mechanism which aims at generating high quality schedules and, at the same time, protecting customers’ privacy. We show that, under the proposed bidding procedure, myopic bidding is the dominant strategy for customers. We also evaluate the privacy and efficiency performance of the proposed mechanism through a computational study.</abstract>

<abstract>In the global competition, companies are propelled by an immense pressure to innovate. The trend to produce more new knowledge-intensive products or services and the rapid progress of information technologies arouse huge interest on knowledge management for innovation. However the strategy of knowledge management is not widely adopted for innovation in industries due to a lack of an effective approach of their integration. This study aims to help the designers to innovate more efficiently based on an integrated approach of knowledge management. Based on this integrated approach, a prototype of distributed knowledge management system for innovation is developed. An industrial application is presented and its initial results indicate the applicability of the approach and the prototype in practice.</abstract>

<title>Design and implementation of a generic nonconformance tracking and recovery (GINTR) system.</title>

<abstract>Nonconformance tracking and recovery remains a major issue in large complex manufacturing systems due to the complexity of manufacturing processes, diversity of parts, high density of nonconformances, and fuzziness of nonconformance information. In addition, the existing nonconformance tracking and recovery systems are usually special purpose systems. They lack the capabilities to migrate to new working domains and integrate with other systems. This research proposes a comprehensive approach to nonconformance tracking and recovery. In conjunction with the soft computing and case-based reasoning (CBR) technologies, a generic intelligent system is designed to address the nonconformance tracking and diagnosis problem. A system built under such a comprehensive approach can track the nonconformance with multiple causes as well as limited knowledge and provide timely diagnostic recovery. A prototype of the GINTR system has been developed using the Microsoft .NET technology, which is considered as the next generation distributed computing paradigm. The prototype system developed is generic, fault tolerant, and agile. It can be adapted to diverse complex manufacturing environments with minimum difficulty.</abstract>

<abstract>Present basis of knowledge management is the efficient share of information. The challenges that modern industrial processes have to face are multimedia information gathering and system integration, through large investments and adopting new technologies. Driven by a notable commercial interest, wireless networks like GSM or IEEE 802.11 are now the focus of industrial attention, because they provide numerous benefits, such as low cost, fast deployment and the ability to develop new applications. However, wireless nets must satisfy industrial requisites: scalability, flexibility, high availability, immunity to interference, security and many others that are crucial in hazardous and noisy environments. This paper presents a thorough survey of all this requirements, reviews the existing wireless solutions, and explores possible matching between industry and the current existing wireless standards.</abstract>

<abstract>This article presents the improvement of a defect recognition system for wooden boards by using knowledge integration from two expert fields. These two kinds of knowledge to integrate respectively concern wood expertise and industrial vision expertise. First of all, extraction, modelling and integration of knowledge use the Natural Language Information Analysis method (NIAM) to be formalized from their natural language expression. Then, to improve a classical industrial vision system , we propose to use the resulting symbolic model of knowledge to partially build a numeric model of wood defect recognition. This model is created according to a tree structure where each inference engine is a fuzzy rule based inference system. The expert knowledge model previously obtained is used to configure each node of the resulting hierarchical structure. The practical results we obtained in industrial conditions show the efficiency of such an approach.</abstract>

<abstract>Modern industry requires the increase of quality of manufactured products with the simultaneous minimization of production time and cost. Therefore the development of faster, more precise measurement techniques is needed. There are many full field optical systems in use that offer multi directional measurement that meet these requirements. The raw output measurement data from these systems is in the form of unsorted clouds of points which may include millions of measurement points. This data has a different structure than data acquired by traditional contact methods. In addition phenomena connected with optical measurement such as reflection and occlusion result in various errors in the obtained cloud. Therefore a new method of analysis has to be developed to process the data and prepare it for metrological verification. This article presents an algorithm to manage measured data from full field optical systems. This includes segmentation of clouds of points so that each point is associated with its corresponding surface of the CAD model and then exported to certified metrological software for analysis.</abstract>

<abstract>The time-to-market of a product is related to the time used in the design process of the product. This is particularly important in fast developing areas of intelligent transport systems (ITS) and products. More powerful design toolkits using advanced computers and software design are helping to shorten time-to-market with improved ITS products. The key to achieving these improvements is a methodology called Time Compressed Product Design And Optimisation (TOPDO). Based on the methodology, a state of the art software and computer framework has been developed for automating the design process, optimising integrated designs through rapid product modelling and analysis, performing systems simulation and capturing a knowledge base for devices, products and systems. This paper focuses on aspects of the computer framework based TOPDO technique that presents the design process as a total systematic framework.</abstract>

<abstract>The focus of this article is to identify, characterise and qualitatively evaluate the existing measures for increasing the utilisation of loading space in intermodal road–rail freight line trains. Normally, these trains operate like intercity passenger trains, because they make short unit load transhipment stops along rail corridors in order to travel comparatively small and short flows. The measures for loading space utilisation include adapting the train's capacity, changing the departure times, altering the train routes and sending trucks to different terminals as well as replacing rail transport with trucks. Some of the measures require improved information sharing, and executives can strengthen the effect of the measures by adding decision support systems and price incentives to transport buyers.</abstract>

<title>Knowledge-based system for collaborative process specification.</title>

<volume>61</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>This paper presents an ontology-based approach for the design of a collaborative business process model (CBP). This CBP is considered as a specification of needs in order to build a collaboration information system (CIS) for a network of organizations. The study is a part of a model-driven engineering approach of the CIS in a specific enterprise interoperability framework that will be summarised. An adaptation of the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) is used to represent the CBP model. We develop a knowledge-based system (KbS) which is composed of three main parts: knowledge gathering, knowledge representation and reasoning, and collaborative business process modelling. The first part starts from a high abstraction level where knowledge from business partners is captured. A collaboration ontology is defined in order to provide a structure to store and use the knowledge captured. In parallel, we try to reuse generic existing knowledge about business processes from the MIT Process Handbook repository. This results in a collaboration process ontology that is also described. A set of rules is defined in order to extract knowledge about fragments of the CBP model from the two previous ontologies. These fragments are finally assembled in the third part of the KbS. A prototype of the KbS has been developed in order to implement and support this approach. The prototype is a computer-aided design tool of the CBP. In this paper, we will present the theoretical aspects of each part of this KbS as well as the tools that we developed and used in order to support its functionalities.</abstract>

<abstract>Rapid prototyping and manufacturing (RP&M) technique has shown a high potential to reduce the cycle and cost of product development, and has been considered as one of crucial enabling tools in digital manufacturing to effectively aid rapid product development. Manufacturing industry is evolving toward digitalization, network and globalization. The Internet, incorporating computers and multimedia, has provided tremendous potential for remote integration and collaboration in business and manufacturing applications. RP&M technique using the Internet can further enhance the design and manufacturing productivity, speed, and economy, as well as share the RP machines. Web-based RP&M systems have been developed and employed to implement remote service and manufacturing for rapid prototyping, enhance the availability of RP&M facilities and improve the capability of rapid product development for a large number of small and medium sized enterprises. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent research on Web-based RP&M systems. Various architectures proposed for Web-based RP&M systems are presented. Furthermore, some key issues and enabling tools to implement the remote RP&M systems, which involve (1) RP&M process selection, (2) RP price quotation, (3) STL Viewer, (4) RP data pre-processing, (5) job planning and scheduling, (6) remote control and monitoring for RP machines, (7) security management, (8) applying new technologies and concepts to the systems, are described in detail. Finally, this review gives an outlook on possible future development and research direction for Web-based RP&M systems.</abstract>

<abstract>Effective benchmarking requires standards for measuring performance across a broad range of organizations. Industry-benchmarking measures the relative performance levels of similar operations, but gathering sufficient data to robustly characterize best performance is the primary hurdle to more widespread implementation. This paper describes the development of an innovative, large-scale benchmarking methodology which employs Internet technology to overcome the data collection problem. We discuss a particular instance of this approach, iDEAs-W—the result of an ongoing collaboration between academia and the warehousing industry. This paper's purpose is to demonstrate the methodology for the warehousing industry and share our insights to allow others to refine the tool for applications in other industries.</abstract>

<abstract>In global recession, outsourcing becomes a question of survival for most executives who need to restore profitability and growth. One of the critical challenges faced by such decisions is the potential risk of leaking confidential information through shared suppliers and partners. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to decompose a product into several sub-components for mitigating the risk of Intellectual Property (IP) leakage caused by inferences in supply chains. A design structure matrix is employed to study the potential risk of IP leakage considering different types of interactions between product components. Based on such a matrix, a clustering algorithm is developed to decompose and allocate the product components regarding IP protection issue. This methodology can be considered as a decision support tool to help the manufacturer select a set of optimal suppliers while minimizing the information leakage risk and the manufacturing cost.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper discusses a multi-agent coordination and control system. The system implements the PROSA architecture [12] and uses a specialized approach to stigmergy. This approach is discussed in relation to more commonplace designs based, for instance, on negotiation protocols. Next, the discussion focuses on the commonalities and differences between the source of inspiration for the system design – food foraging in ant colonies – and the resulting coordination control system itself. In particular, the discussion reveals that the multi-agent coordination and control system is based on deeper insights rather than a superficial translation of the biological example.</abstract>

<abstract>Production agility becomes a measurable quantity when its scope is limited to those agility enablers that are demonstrated to positively influence the operation of a company. Strategic and tactical planning, along with flexible production, communication and cooperation infrastructures, were empirically demonstrated, in prior independent research, as significant predictors of financial performance. This paper introduces an index for measuring the ability of a company to timely and profitably exploit windows of upcoming commercial opportunity and a model for calculating the long-term cost of software in agile production environments. The evaluation focuses on the effects of the production infrastructure on the strategic and tactical ability of the company. Through the introduced index and software cost model, the impact of software on the agility of automatic production systems is explained, along with the benefits from reconfigurable production control software build upon open standards.</abstract>

<abstract>The adoption of information technology (IT) along a supply chain has increasingly become a necessity for enhancing supply chain performance. Organizations in a supply chain often adopt IT due to the institutional pressure exerted by their supply chain partners. The implications of the different types of institutional isomorphism, namely coercion, mimesis, and norms, are explored from both the perspectives of firms that have taken the initiatives to adopt IT and those that have followed their supply chain partners to adopt IT. The possible impact of the different types of institutional isomorphism discussed here can help managers to better understand the institutional pressure they are putting on and/or of adapting to their supply chain partners, in particular, the possible problems and the injunctions/compliances they may face in the course of adopting IT for the management of their supply chains. The implications of institutional isomorphism on the adoption of IT for supply chain management are discussed.</abstract>

<title>Framework for the support of knowledge-based engineering template update.</title>

<volume>63</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>5</number>
<abstract>The present paper addresses the problem of knowledge templates update in product design. A framework is proposed that helps design engineers during the template update process by providing a decision support system and tools in order to support template instances update. The former is an issue-based information system designed to allow the collaboration between various experts in order to solve template related problems. The latter aims at providing a sequence of updates to follow in order to propagate the modifications on templates to their instances. This sequence is computed with data extracted from models and templates, which are stored in an ontology designed for this purpose. The ontology is used to represent and to infer knowledge about templates, products and their relations. This facilitates the construction of the update sequence as it provides an efficient overview of relationships, even implicit ones. The proposed framework fills an actual gap concerning template updates, which slows down templates adoption for large-scale industrial use.</abstract>

<title>An algorithm for transforming design text ROM diagram into FBS model.</title>

<volume>64</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>5</number>
<abstract>In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to transform a ROM diagram obtained from a design text into a FBS model. Each state of the transformation process is defined by four features: ROM (Recursive Object Model), POS (Part of Speech), PES (Product–Environment System), and FBS (Function–Behavior–State). The transformation algorithm is thus constituted by transition rules which change one transformation state to another, and procedures which apply the transition rules to a given ROM diagram. A software prototype R2FBS is presented as a proof of concept to assist the transformation. Two examples are used to demonstrate how the proposed approach works.</abstract>

<title>Robust and efficient automated detection of tooling defects in polished stone.</title>

<volume>56</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>8-9</number>
<abstract>The automated detection of process-induced defects such as tooling marks is a common and important problem in machine vision. Such defects are often distinguishable from natural flaws and other features by their geometric form, for example their circularity or linearity. This paper discusses the automated inspection of polished stone, where process-induced defects present as circular arcs. This is a particularly demanding circle detection problem due to the large radii and disrupted form of the arcs, the complex nature of the stone surface, the presence of other natural flaws and the fact that each circle is represented by a relatively small proportion of its total boundary. Once detected and characterized, data relating to the defects may be used to adaptively control the polishing process. We discuss the hardware requirements of imaging such a surface and present a novel implementation of a randomised circle detection algorithm that is able to reliably detect these defects. The algorithm minimizes the number of iterations required, based on a failure probability specified by the user, thus providing optimum efficiency for a specified confidence whilst requiring no prior knowledge of the image. The probabilities of spurious results are also analyzed, and an optimization routine introduced to address the inaccuracies often associated with randomized techniques. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of this approach.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper reports a collaborative product design framework and a prototype system that supports multiple CAD systems. The key contribution is an ‘operation’-based, multi-application oriented, and near real-time collaboration mechanism which can significantly reduce collaboration communication load over the network. The mechanism is discussed and demonstrated with examples. To support the proposed multi-application collaboration system, a fine-grain feature-oriented product database is used. This research is a continued effort based on a shared common product modeling scheme, which covers fundamental issues of generic feature, feature level interoperability, engineering intent and operation definitions.</abstract>

<title>Enterprise modeling of a project-oriented fractal company for SMEs networking.</title>

<abstract>To address competitive threats and concentrate in their core competences and strengths networking is the alternative of choice for survival and prosperity of most small and medium enterprises (SMEs) all over the world. For networking advantages to be fully grasped, an enterprise model describing the main organizational structure and relationships, information flows, management roles, actor behavior and constraints in the network is required. This work presents a conceptual model for SMEs networking based on the fractal company approach and concepts like projects, resources, goals, specialized actors, plans, and relationships thereof. The fractal company idea is a conceptual enterprise design that seeks to achieve a high degree of flexibility to react and adapt quickly to environmental changes using decentralized and autonomous organizational units known as fractals. In this work, each fractal management unit is modeled as a project. The fractal company is thus seen as a temporary set of client–server and delegation-to-do relationships among project-managers interacting so as to diversify product portfolio, gain economy of scale and share expensive costs. The proposed enterprise model can be used to specify the requirements of an integrated information and management system for virtual SMEs networking. The enterprise model is exemplified using a case study related to process development of a new pharmaceutical product in a SME network of the specialty chemical sector.</abstract>

<abstract>Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are complex cyber-physical systems which are widely used in industry. This paper presents a robust approach to design and implement PLC-based embedded systems. Timed automata are used to model the controller and its environment. We validate the design model with resort to model checking techniques. We propose an algorithm to generate PLC code from timed automata and implement this algorithm with a prototype tool. This method can condense the developing process and guarantee the correctness of PLC programs. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the method.</abstract>

<title>An integration architecture for knowledge management systems and business process management systems.</title>

<abstract>Recently, interests in the notion of process-oriented knowledge management (PKM) from academia and industry have been significantly increased. Comprehensive research and development requirements along with a cogent framework, however, have not been proposed for integrating knowledge management (KM) and business process management (BPM), which were proposed independently. Based on a comprehensive framework that reflects lifecycle requirements of both KM and BPM, this paper proposes an architecture for integrating knowledge management systems (KMSs) and business process management systems (BPMSs) to combine the advantages of the two paradigms. The paper first defines the concept of process knowledge and classifies it into three types. Then, it suggests how the functionalities of existing KMSs and BPMSs must be extended to support the three types of process knowledge while satisfying the lifecycle requirements of both knowledge and business processes. The architecture, which is comprehensive since it is derived from the extended requirements from the lifecycle perspective, will provide a basis for research and development of process-oriented knowledge management systems. A prototype system is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture.</abstract>

<abstract>Sintering, a thermally activated diffusion process, is used to densify particulate materials. During the densification process, there is concomitant volumetric shrinkage of the powder compact to the final desired part shape. Additionally, shear deformation can occur in response to deviatoric stresses in the body, such as gravity, thermal stresses, and stress gradients due to internal density differences. Finite element modeling of sintering deformation can greatly aid in reverse engineering green part shapes, thus improving dimensional precision of final parts. However, the constitutive equations that govern the rheological response of a porous body during sintering are notoriously difficult to characterize. In situ video-imaging of a simply supported beam, deforming under its own weight during sintering, has been effectively employed in determining the apparent viscosity of the densifying material. This paper describes this experimental technique and the implementation of the results in a finite element analysis. It demonstrates the efficacy of the characterized constitutive equations by a finite element simulation example using 316L stainless steel with 0.2% boron addition.</abstract>

<abstract>In collaborative product commerce (CPC), design activities need to be carried out concurrently with the identification of potential manufacturing partners based on the design requirements and manufacturing constraints. This paper presents a web service based CPC framework, WSCPC (web services for CPC). WSCPC integrates design process, business plan, and assembly operations using web services in which a task is regarded as a service that an organization can provide and is outsourced to other companies on the fly. In addition, we propose a service-oriented process model that enables a machine to locate actively a CPC service, to check service capabilities, and to execute collaborative services into an optimized process workflow. Our service-oriented process model is a general drawing to realize functionalities, such as defining CPC service, enacting CPC service, and monitoring the executing status of CPC service. CPC, therefore, can utilize web services to not only discover diverse services of design, manufacturing and logistics, but configure collaborative process design, supporting service oriented CPC within WSCPC framework.</abstract>

<abstract>Demand-driven manufacturing is an extremely unstable planning environment compared to forecast-driven manufacturing. This requires preparation and makes knowledge of demand behaviour even more important for planning and control. The basic assumptions of pre-ante allocation based on forecast of independent end-products demand are critical for manufacturing planning and control in general. However, the importance is higher for demand-driven manufacturing than forecast-driven manufacturing. This is due to the sensitivity of demand-driven manufacturing to demand fluctuations, e.g. time and interdependency of demand rates, due to the customer order decoupling point.</abstract>

<abstract>Current product lifecycle management (PLM) systems properly support the development of a product from the embodiment design stage to detail design and manufacturing phases; on the contrary, marginal support is provided to the earliest stages of conceptual design. Besides, the front end of product development is supported by an emerging technology, namely computer-aided innovation systems (CAI), which nevertheless are still poorly integrated with the following phases of the design process. The paper presents an original computer-based approach aimed at supporting embodiment design phases, which results very efficient for improving the interoperability of CAI and PLM systems and thus at extending the domain of application of these tools. The potential of the approach proposed by the authors is clarified through three exemplary case studies.</abstract>

<abstract>This study examines the relationships among perceived usability before actual use, task completion time, and preference, and the effects of design attributes on user preference for e-commerce web sites. Nine online bookstore web sites were used by ten participants. Results indicate: (1) pre-use usability and task completion time were correlated; (2) the relationship between pre-use usability and preference was greater than that of task completion time and preference; (3) design attribute assessments after actual use were highly intercorrelated; and (4) organizational structure and layout had a greater effect on user preference than aesthetic aspects, such as color and typography. These findings can be used to construct a conceptual framework for understanding user preferences and to develop design guidelines to yield more highly preferred e-commerce web sites. Also, the methodology in this study can be applied to other computerized-applications.</abstract>

<abstract>Due to the increasing competition in global markets, many European garment manufacturers have had to undergo significant restructuring and were forced to create leaner value-adding processes. As a result, the majority of the manufacturing operations have been outsourced to low labor cost countries. At the same time, production logistics as well as information and communication technologies have gained importance, in order to keep job functions requiring higher qualifications within Europe. Another challenge concerns the introduction of customized products into the production processes which previously had been designed for manufacturing of large volumes. Prior to implementing such changes, the consequences with respect to production logistics as well as the financial impacts should be examined. The case study presented in this paper uses a simulation tool for these purposes. Different scenarios developed for a garment company were analyzed. Based on the results, recommendations for the further development of the regarded company were deduced.</abstract>

<title>An adaptive multi-parameter based dispatching strategy for single-loop interbay material handling systems.</title>
<pages>175-186</pages>
<year>2011</year>
<volume>62</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>The automation of interbay systems in 300 mm semiconductor wafer fabrication systems (SWFSs) is complex due to the dynamic, stochastic and mass transportation demands, transportation deadlocks, and vehicle blockages. An adaptive multi-parameter based (AMP) dispatching policy is proposed to obtain better performance of the interbay material handling systems and SWFSs. The system parameters, including vehicle's distance, lot's due date, lot's waiting time, and lot's origin–destination buffer status parameters are simultaneously considered, and the multi-parameter's weight coefficients are adjusted adaptively by Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy logic method. With experimental data from an interbay system of 300 mm SWFSs and running simulation experiments, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach has better performance in terms of cycle time, throughput, due-date satisfaction rate, and vehicle utilization compared to conventional single- and multi-attribute dispatching methodologies.</abstract>

<title>Knowledge formalization in experience feedback processes: An ontology-based approach.</title>

<abstract>Because of the current trend of integration and interoperability of industrial systems, their size and complexity continue to grow making it more difficult to analyze, to understand and to solve the problems that happen in their organizations. Continuous improvement methodologies are powerful tools in order to understand and to solve problems, to control the effects of changes and finally to capitalize knowledge about changes and improvements. These tools involve suitably represent knowledge relating to the concerned system. Consequently, knowledge management (KM) is an increasingly important source of competitive advantage for organizations. Particularly, the capitalization and sharing of knowledge resulting from experience feedback are elements which play an essential role in the continuous improvement of industrial activities. In this paper, the contribution deals with semantic interoperability and relates to the structuring and the formalization of an experience feedback (EF) process aiming at transforming information or understanding gained by experience into explicit knowledge. The reuse of such knowledge has proved to have significant impact on achieving the missions of companies. However, the means of describing the knowledge objects of an experience generally remain informal. Based on an experience feedback process model and conceptual graphs, this paper takes domain ontology as a framework for the clarification of explicit knowledge and know-how, the aim of which is to get lessons learned descriptions that are significant, correct and applicable.</abstract>

<title>Implementation and optimisation of ERP systems: A better integration of processes, roles, knowledge and user competencies.</title>

<abstract>The implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems is nowadays a key issue for companies. The problems that can appear during their integration, which is always a difficult task, are nowadays better identified, even if their origins are often multiple and complex. This study focuses on the integration of the human resource characteristics in business processes, which is a key issue for the ERP adoption and optimisation phases. In that purpose, it is suggested to better adapt business processes to human actors by explicitly taking into account concepts like the role, competence and knowledge of human resources. It is shown on a practical case—the implementation of PeopleSoft™ in a university—how these concepts may optimise ERP implementations by better identifying the requirements and possibilities of the workforce, with the final goal of increasing the efficiency and acceptability of the system to be implemented.</abstract>

<abstract>In today's economy managers expect new strategies and policies to be implemented quickly. Yet practice shows that current systems are not able to implement changes within a short time frame. Nowadays a variety of technologies including semantic web services, business rules and software agents are available as building blocks for interoperable systems. Yet these technologies are rarely used in combination and are not adapting operational processes to changing business strategies and other requirements. A generic architecture is presented in this paper which is able to adapt processes to changing requirements based on three types of knowledge repositories (domain ontology, service description and business rule) which, when combined, allows for direct employment of strategy in business processes. The architecture is tested using scenarios. The testing shows that the architecture improves the interoperability between policy/strategic and operational level and results in a higher agility and better compliance.</abstract>

<title>Efficient tool path computation using multi-core GPUs.</title>
<pages>50-56</pages>

<volume>64</volume>

<number>1</number>
<abstract>Tool path generation is one of the most complex problems in Computer Aided Manufacturing. Although some efficient strategies have been developed, most of them are only useful for standard machining. However, the algorithms used for tool path computation demand a higher computation performance, which makes the implementation on many existing systems very slow or even impractical. Hardware acceleration is an incremental solution that can be cleanly added to these systems while keeping everything else intact. It is completely transparent to the user. The cost is much lower and the development time is much shorter than replacing the computers by faster ones. This paper presents an optimisation that uses a specific graphic hardware approach using the power of multi-core Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) in order to improve the tool path computation. This improvement is applied on a highly accurate and robust tool path generation algorithm. The paper presents, as a case of study, a fully implemented algorithm used for turning lathe machining of shoe lasts. A comparative study will show the gain achieved in terms of total computing time. The execution time is almost two orders of magnitude faster than modern PCs.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper proposes an agent-based composable simulation framework to address the challenges of integration, composability, distributed coordination, and interaction for the development of a virtual prototype of fluid power system. The approach proposed represents each virtual hydraulic component by a domain agent (DA). The agents are then gathered into a multi-agent system, which models the hydraulic system as a whole. The virtual prototyping evaluation depends on the communication and collaboration of multiple agents. A case study shows that agent-based composable simulation can predict the overall system performance. A prototype implementation of the proposed system is presented in this paper.</abstract>

<abstract>Environmental issues have become an imperative concern for most companies in relation to modern product development. Special procedures have to be taken during the product development process to comply with recent green directives. Product structure is recognized as a critical factor that provides effective means for reducing environmental impact in product end-of-life. However, most previous studies failed to leverage the vast latitude at the design stage due to the assumption of a fixed product structure. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a CAD-based approach that allows automatic variation of 3D product structure by means of changing the combination of parts, selecting the assembly method, and rearranging the assembly sequence. A computing scheme uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) techniques to produce an optimal product structure from the design alternatives generated by the approach. This corresponds to lower assembly/disassembly costs, while complying with specified recycling and recovering rates. The scheme also chooses a smaller set of parts that needs to be disassembled and determines an economical disassembly process. Implemented in a commercial CAD system, the test results demonstrated the effectiveness of this scheme in green product design in a cost-effective manner.</abstract>

<abstract>In industry, functional tolerancing of mechanisms is today more and more based on ISO GPS (Geometrical Product Specification) and ASME standards. In this context, the CLIC method (French acronym for “Cotation en Localisation avec Influence des Contacts”) has been developed in our laboratory since 1998. The method describes the complete process involved in functional tolerancing. The three dimensional calculation of the result of tolerance chain is formulated functions of tolerances and offsets of surfaces, based on transfer by tolerance zone or by virtual boundary. However, the current standards are incomplete to specify complex junctions, for example to respect a minimum clearance. The paper outlines that the independence principle does not permit to limit the orientation inside location zone in particular case with floating datum reference frame. Then, two main contributions are developed, the extension of material conditions on complex surfaces and the definition of a new association criterion in order to specify hybrid prismatic surfaces with a surface contact zone and a zone with clearance. In this aim, the paper advises six propositions as possible extension of standards of tolerancing.</abstract>

<abstract>Industry today requires new technologies to address increasingly complex product development and the high expectations of customers. Computer Supported Collaborative Design (CSCD) emerged in response to this requirement. With the rapid advancement of Internet and Web-based technologies, CSCD has been a very active R&D area in the past 15 years and has progressed dramatically. To achieve its full potential, more and more research and commercial CSCD systems have been recently developed. The depth and breadth of these applications and systems are far beyond the traditional definition of concurrent engineering. This paper presents a review of the R&D literature on CSCD, from the pre-CSCD technologies of the 1980s to today's state-of-the-art CSCD. Research challenges and opportunities on CSCD are also discussed and highlighted.</abstract>

<title>A balanced scorecard based framework for assessing the strategic impacts of ERP systems.</title>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>Although there is no analytical framework for assessing the organizational benefits of ERP systems, several researchers have indicated that the balanced scorecard (BSC) approach may be an appropriate technique for evaluating the performance of ERP systems. This paper fills this gap in the literature by providing a balanced-scorecard based framework for valuing the strategic contributions of an ERP system. Using a successful SAP implementation by a major international aircraft engine manufacturing and service organization as a case study, this paper illustrates that an ERP system does indeed impacts the business objectives of the firm and derives a new innovative ERP framework for valuing the strategic impacts of ERP systems. The ERP valuation framework, called here an ERP scorecard, integrates the four Kaplan and Norton's balanced scorecard dimensions with Zuboff's automate, informate and transformate goals of information systems to provide a practical approach for measuring the contributions and impacts of ERP systems on the strategic goals of the company.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper deals with the deployment of industrial control applications in distributed devices (considered as multi-tasking Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)). These applications are developed according to the component-based standard IEC 61499. In this standard, a function block is an event triggered component and the application is a network of distributed blocks on several devices. To deploy these blocks in feasible OS tasks of the execution support, we propose a hybrid scheduling approach allowing in particular to check according to specifications the temporal behavior of the application in devices and also on the communication network. This approach is based on static and dynamic policies. The static policy allows to construct OS tasks from function blocks, whereas the dynamic policy allows their scheduling at run-time.</abstract>

<title>Electricity agents in smart grid markets.</title>

<year>2013</year>
<volume>64</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>This paper presents a novel architecture of electricity agents in smart grid markets. The architecture implements a middleware that allows standard agent plug-ins representing “smart grid” elements in a two-way power flow. Agent operations are automated to allow demand variations and exploring a wider spectrum of trade opportunities in an efficient manner, while coordinating with the system operator for reliability, security, and stability. We give trade and operation computational models of power grid components and their interaction protocols and authentication in a multi-agent framework. Trade models are both pool and multilateral based. Operation models respect power dispatch limits, generation and transmission constraints, and spinning reserve requirements. The models are coded as part of the agent software. The protocols are KQML (Knowledge Query Manipulation Language) based communication. An IEEE 5-bus grid system is used for illustration. The testing results for different load profiles show better distribution of market sales and a market clearing price convergence very close to the marginal cost of generation supply, thus an implication of economic efficiency of energy resources, as well as security and power quality compared to traditional electricity trade models based on Cournot and Bertrand estimated clearing prices.</abstract>

<title>Information requirements for e-maintenance strategic planning: A benchmark study in complex production systems.</title>

<abstract>The selection of the maintenance policy is one of the most important decisions of strategic maintenance management. It guarantees not only adequate control of the maintenance costs but also competitive performances of the production system in terms of safety, availability and quality. An optimised selection of the maintenance policy also serves the competitiveness of an e-maintenance service. This calls for fine tuning with the conditions of one plant operations, henceforth integration is required between the plant management and the e-maintenance service provider. Integration may be organised at different levels, i.e. at the strategic or operational level. The paper is concerned with the strategic planning of an e-maintenance service, to properly size the maintenance logistics support. It will present a discussion on the information required to select the policy in the case of an age based component replacement. A test will also prove the information requirements in the context of a simulated machining line wherein the most important loss is system unavailability. A benchmark study is performed therein, in order to analyse how the selection of the maintenance policy may change when information is collected with regard to the production system as a whole instead of its separate equipments. The study will demonstrate that the maintenance policy may change depending on the analysis level, i.e. from equipment level to production system level. The analysis at equipment level will reveal itself to be not so accurate, if compared with the analysis at the system level, as far as the line layout is endowed with some flexibility features and it is operated in a range of medium to high saturation rates. A more comprehensive analysis at the production system level will conversely achieve better performances though a reduced number of preventive maintenance stops during the e-maintenance service operation.</abstract>

<abstract>Dagstuhl seminar no. 10102 on discrete event logistic systems recognized a network of persistent models to be a “Grand Challenge.” Such on-line model network will offer an infrastructure that facilitates the management of logistic operations. This ambition to create a network of persistent models implies a radical shift for model design activities as the objective is an infrastructure rather than application-specific solutions. In particular, model developers can no longer assume that they know what their model will be used for. It is no longer possible to design for the expected.</abstract>

The paper is based on an in-depth case study and presents a solution delivery framework that can help companies in the professional printing industry devise, deliver and price integrated solutions. The case of Océ suggests that succeeding as a solution provider requires developing the capability to provide highly customised service logic-based solutions while retaining the capability to provide, efficiently, standardised goods logic-based solutions. Hence, it suggests that adopting different delivery approaches to address customers with different types of needs can help achieve such a capability.</abstract>

<title>3D CAD model retrieval with perturbed Laplacian spectra.</title>
<pages>1-11</pages>
<year>2012</year>
<volume>63</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>This paper presents a novel approach to the 3D CAD model retrieval, whereby the 3D models are treated and matched as undirected graphs. While there is much success made in the matching of graphs based on their spectral decomposition, most of these approaches consider smooth surfaces and are not suitable for CAD models because of their complex topology and singular structure. In the proposed approach, the models are simplified based on the piecewise flat properties of the surfaces first, and a perturbed Laplacian spectrum approach is then applied to characterize the shape. These spectral values are used as samples for spectral distribution estimation. The perturbed spectral distributions of different models are then compared by their KL-divergence for model retrieval. The proposed approach is tested with models from known 3D CAD database for verification.</abstract>

<title>Metamodeling development for reliability-based design optimization of automotive body structure.</title>
<pages>729-741</pages>

<volume>62</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>Metamodels are commonly used in reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) due to the enormously expensive computation cost of numerical simulations. However, for large-scale design optimization of automotive body structure, with the increasing number of design variable and enhanced nonlinearity degree of structural performance, polynomial response surface which is commonly used for vehicle design optimization often suffers exponentially increased computation burden and serious loss of approximation accuracy. In this paper, support vector regression, along with other four complex metamodeling techniques including moving least square, artificial neural network, radial basis function and Kriging, is investigated for approximating frontal crashworthiness performance which is one of the most highly nonlinear performances. It aims at testing support vector regression and providing advanced metamodeling technique for RBDO of automotive body structure. Approximation results are compared in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Based on the frontal crashworthiness example, it is found that support vector regression and moving least square are preferable techniques to approximate structural performances with good accuracy. But support vector regression is recommended for its computational efficiency and better approximation potential. Moreover, the ensemble of support vector regression, moving least square, Kriging and artificial neural network is an effective alternative and is proved, in the RBDO example for the lightweight design of front body structure, to outperform any other single metamodel. The remarkable predominance indicates that the ensemble of support vector regression, moving least square, Kriging and artificial neural network holds great potential in approximating highly nonlinear performances for RBDO of automotive body structure.</abstract>

<title>Towards online planning for open-air engineering processes.</title>
<pages>242-251</pages>

<volume>64</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>Recently, most open-air engineering processes, such as open-pit mining, road construction and agriculture farming, are performed with high-tech mobile equipment. The modern technology of the equipment allows optimisation of the operations with respect to the operating conditions. When several mobile equipments are used together in a process, the benefits from their individual optimisation may disappear. Therefore, the execution of an open-air engineering process by cooperating mobile equipment needs to be carefully planned for their effective utilisation. However, dynamics in the open and distributed operating environment of these processes make the planning truly complex. Important planning information, such as the duration of operations, cannot be accurately determined in advance. The progress of the process, equipment performance and operating conditions need to be monitored and this information should be considered for the planning. This paper presents an approach to develop an online planning system with a focus on enhancing process visibility to enable better-informed decision making. To realise these objectives, the PROSA reference architecture and the accompanying delegate multi-agent system are considered. The online planning system based on PROSA is model-driven. It uses executable models to model operations, generating short-term operational forecasts. The forecasting mechanism provides a realistic view on the progress of the process, alerts on potential problems and opportunities and enables to evaluate planning alternatives. This online planning system is implemented as a prototype for open-pit mine planning. However, due to the model-driven nature of the system, this approach is equally applicable to other outdoor engineering processes.</abstract>

<abstract>In modern manufacturing systems, Information Technologies (IT) are closely linked to production operational functioning. To be a reliable service provider, IT Departments must ensure an adequately sized IT infrastructure, to support present and future industrial activity. As such, quantitative tools are useful for IT managers to anticipate future use of IT resources, on the basis of production-related explanatory variables. This paper proposes a modelling process to build such a tool. This modelling process is organized through two main sequences, exploratory and explanatory, and mixes qualitative and quantitative analyses. Taking advantage of the masses of data stored in modern manufacturing systems, it allows a progressive understanding of the relationships between the different domains of the IT architecture. To illustrate the application of the modelling process, this endeavour was conducted in a partnership with STMicroelectronics, to base the research upon and provide a case study. The latter established quantified links among the activities of the STMicroelectronics Manufacturing Execution System server and several manufacturing related explanatory variables. This paper demonstrates that using such statistical approaches through our modelling process, can overcome a typical issue of modern IT systems capacity planning works: establishing direct and quantified links between business and IT activities.</abstract>

<abstract>The design and implementation of a PLM solution in a cross-company environment is a complex and labour intensive operation, which is often coupled with a Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) project to better deploy technologies as well as methodologies and to target the system implementation on the real company needs. Enterprise Modelling (EM) languages are typically used to collect and share process knowledge among the BPR participants. Plenty of techniques are actually available at this scope and it is not always easy to understand how to select and use them in the different steps of re-engineering. The main purpose of this paper is to perform a qualitative analysis of three well known EM languages (IDEF, UML and ARIS) and to propose a new methodology, based on their integrated use, supporting BPR efforts in the Product Development domain.</abstract>

<abstract>A web-based decision support tool using adaptive assessment approach is developed in this research as a guiding tool throughout the journey to lean. In the past several decades, pioneers of lean manufacturing have developed numerous useful tools and techniques to realize the waste-elimination concept. With the abundant lean tools, applying the right tools at the right time on the right spot relies on extensive knowledge and experiences. Yet, such an expertise is not always accessible or affordable. This paper presents an adaptive lean assessment approach that provides an effective way to guide the lean implementation process. Using the web-based program, an assessment model is generated adaptively for each user to evaluate the current status of the system, pinpoint the urgent targets for improvement, and identify the appropriate tools and techniques for developing action plans. With the decision support information, lean concepts can be implemented more systematically and efficiently.</abstract>

<title>STL rapid prototyping bio-CAD model for CT medical image segmentation.</title>

<abstract>This paper presents a simple process to construct 3D rapid prototyping (RP) physical models for computer tomography (CT) medical images segmentation. The use of stereolithography (STL) triangular meshes as a basis for RP construction facilitates the simplification of the process of converting CT images to an RP model. This is achieved by constructing the STL triangular meshes directly from data points without having to draw the curve model first. The grey prediction algorithm is used to sort contour point data in each layer of the medical image. The contour difference detection operation is used to sequence the points for each layer. The 3D STL meshes are then constructed by this proposed layer-by-layer sequence meshes algorithm to build the STL file. Once this STL file is saved, a 3D physical model of the medical image can be fabricated by RP manufacturing, and its virtual reality model can also be presented for visualization. CT images of a human skull and femur bone were used as the case studies for the construction of the 3D solid model with medical images. The STL models generated using this new methodology were compared to commercial computer-aided design (CAD) models. The results of this comparative analysis show that this new methodology is statistically comparable to that of the CAD software. The results of this research are therefore clinically reliable in reconstructing 3D bio-CAD models for CT medical images.</abstract>

<abstract>This work provides an automatic and non-intrusive tool to objectively monitoring the raising process by measuring the height and the density of the fibres emerging from a raised cloth (pile). These parameters are assessed by a numerical procedure, which elaborates the images provided by an appositely developed machine-vision system. The proposed approach allows the investigation and the control of the raising process and has been validated by experimental measurements performed on a set of specimens (cloths) with several raising degrees. The comparison between the results obtained by the proposed procedure and the ones coming from a widely accepted textile-measuring device (fabric assurance by simple testing, FAST) is also provided.</abstract>

<title>A design-and-play approach to accessible user interface development in Ambient Intelligence environments.</title>

<abstract>User interface development in Ambient Intelligence (AmI) environments is anticipated to be a particularly complex and programming intensive endeavor. Additionally, AmI environments should ensure accessibility and usability of interactive technologies by users with different characteristics and requirements in a mainstream fashion. Therefore, appropriate user interface development methods and tools are required, capable of both reducing development efforts and ‘injecting’ accessibility issues into AmI applications from the early design stages. This paper introduces two tools, named AmIDesigner and AmIPlayer, which have been specifically developed to address the above challenges through automatic generation of accessible Graphical User Interfaces in AmI environments. The combination of these two tools offers a simple and rapid design-and-play approach, and the running user interfaces produced integrate non-visual feedback and a scanning mechanism to support accessibility. AmIDesigner and AmIPlayer have been evaluated to assess their usability by designers, and have been put to practice in the redevelopment of a light control application in a smart environment as a case study demonstrating the viability of the design-and-play approach. The results confirm the usefulness and usability of the tools themselves. Overall, the proposed approach has the potential to contribute significantly to the development, up-take and user acceptance of AmI technologies in the home environment.</abstract>

<title>The application of interoperability requirement specification and verification to collaborative processes in industry.</title>

<abstract>Interoperability is becoming a crucial issue for industry, and a lack of interoperability can be seen as an important barrier to collaborative work, in both public (inter-enterprise) and private (intra-enterprise) collaborative processes. Indeed, interoperability is generally defined as the ability of enterprises to interact within a collaborative process. Prior to any effective collaboration, it is necessary to inform enterprises, which aim to work together, whether or not they would be able to interoperate. Research on interoperability has shown the benefits of measuring and evaluating interoperability, by using several frameworks and maturity models. However, approaches for detecting and anticipating interoperability problems do not seem to exist. Our research proposes to use formal verification techniques to detect different types of interoperability problems. On the one hand, this means being able to define the particular interoperability needs to be considered. On the other hand, it requires these needs to be formalized as a set of unambiguous and, as formally stated as possible, requirements. Moreover, interoperability requirements can have temporal or a-temporal features. To detect interoperability problems in anticipative way, interoperability requirements must be checked by means of a target process model. Three complementary verification techniques are used to verify interoperability requirements in a collaborative process model. The verification technique used depends on the aspect and the level of abstraction of the requirement to be verified. This paper focuses and illustrates the detection of interoperability problems using verification techniques.</abstract>

<abstract>The planning and decision support capabilities of the manufacturing planning and control system, which provides the core of any enterprise resource planning package, can be enhanced substantively by the inclusion of a decision support module as an add-on at the midterm planning level. This module, called advanced resource planning (ARP), provides a parameter-setting process, with the ultimate goal of yielding realistic information about production lead times for scheduling purposes, sales and marketing, strategic and operational decision making, and suppliers and customers. This article illustrates the ARP approach with reports from several real-life implementations by large industrial companies.</abstract>

<abstract>An important task in computer graphics, computer-aided design and reverse engineering is the mathematical modeling of three-dimension complex surfaces based on digitized points. However, there are several open problems that are viewed as a bottleneck in the mathematical modeling. The topology is unknown. The reconstruction is based on parameterization and fitting stages. The above problems are influenced mainly by the parameterization, and the issue of parameterization for curve and surface fitting has been a difficult one since the advent of computers in design engineering. To resolve the above problems, in this paper a new strategy based on region-by-region adaptation is presented to surfaces fitting for digitized points. Furthermore, the “regions” used for adaptive surface fitting can be applied extendedly to three industrial applications: (1) tool path generation; (2) slicing; and (3) surface triangulation.</abstract>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>The divergent interpretations of data, the lack of common metadata and the absence of universal reference data hinder governments from seamless data exchange, information systems integration and the delivery of cross-border public services. To overcome this, governments develop e-Government metadata repositories to store reusable data models, schemata, taxonomies and codelists. We use the term semantic interoperability asset to refer to these types of resources. These repositories however differ in their scope, target group, implementation technologies and end-user interfaces. Although, the semantic content they include can often be reused, even bypass the domain it was originally designed for, their physical isolation and the heterogeneity of the assets’ descriptions hamper the reusability of common concepts and cross-repository search. To deal with these challenges, this paper introduces the Asset Description Metadata Schema, an initiative of the ISA programme of the European Commission, which aims to deliver a common metamodel for semantic interoperability assets.</abstract>

<abstract>Interoperability is defined as the ability for two (or more) systems or components to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged. There is increasing demand for interoperability between individual software systems. Developing an interoperability evaluation model between software and information systems is difficult, and becoming an important challenge. An interoperability evaluation model allows knowing the degree of interoperability, and lead to the improvement of interoperability. This paper describes the existing interoperability evaluation models, and performs a comparative analysis among their findings to determine the similarities and differences in their philosophy and implementation. This analysis yields a set of recommendations for any party that is open to the idea of creating or improving an interoperability evaluation model.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents an ontology-based approach to enable semantic interoperability and reasoning over the product information model. The web ontology language (OWL) and the semantic web rule language (SWRL) in the Semantic Web are employed to construct the product information model. The traditional modeling language called EXPRESS is discussed. The representation methodology for EXPRESS-driven product information model is then proposed. The key of the representation methodology is mapping from EXPRESS to OWL/SWRL. Some illustrated examples are presented.</abstract>

<title>Identifying functional modules using generalized directed graphs: Definition and application.</title>

<volume>61</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>We extend traditional directed graphs to generalized directed graphs, making them capable of representing function structures as graphs. In a generalized directed graph, vectors are used to denote the edges, which are pairs of sub-function vertices connected by a relationship, and elements of the vectors indicate different types of flow (i.e., material, energy, or signal) on which sub-functions operate. Based on these definitions, we formalize the three heuristics proposed by Stone et al. into rules to identify functional modules in function structures: (1) sequential flow rule, (2) parallel flow rule and (3) flow transformation rule. The arithmetic for identifying functional modules based on these formalized rules is developed, and a computer-aided software tool is created to facilitate this process. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to a function structure for a power screwdriver, and the results compare favorably to those obtained using the three heuristics.</abstract>

<title>A multilevel explanation of end-user computing satisfaction with an enterprise resource planning system within an international manufacturing organization.</title>

<volume>60</volume>

<abstract>The present research results assume that end-user computing satisfaction (EUCS) of an enterprise resource planning system (ERP system) depends on users’ positive perception of determinants on multiple organizational levels. Hence, rather than investigating a precise theory of narrow focus, this research addresses the users’ view of the impact of major project and organizational issues on EUCS. This requires a multilevel approach to research. A hierarchical regression analysis based on data from 123 middle managers and super-users from a single company with operating units in 10 western European countries confirmed this theory. Still, a path analysis suggests that determinants representing the near user environment (communication and decision-making patterns between users and experts locally during the ERP system implementation process, and communication with peers in organizational units other than that of the respondent) contribute more consistently to EUCS than determinants on other organizational levels. User training plays a role in helping users understand the relevance of ERP system project business objectives, but training does not help in explaining EUCS. The study points to future research in the areas of instrument development as well as an increased understanding of stakeholders’ views, determinant definitions, relationships among determinants, and measures of ERP system outcome.</abstract>

However, there are two major omissions in existing work: firstly, a unified framework in the process of product conceptualization has not been well addressed; and secondly, it is imperative to attain an effective data-mining approach to support the product conceptualization process. Based on this understanding, the proposed approach aims at postulating an axiomatic product conceptualization system (APCS) to meet the demand of product concept development. The proposed APCS comprises three cohesively interacting modules, namely, knowledge elicitation module using laddering technique; knowledge representation module using design knowledge hierarchy (DKH); and knowledge synthesis module using restricted Coulomb energy (RCE) neural network. Accordingly, this system offers a method of making design decisions via a web-based data-mining product conceptualization approach. A case study on wood golf club design has been used for system illustration.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents a P4LM methodology which allows the management of Projects, Products, Processes, and Proceeds on a Digital Mock-Up (DMU). The aim of our methodology is to allow a high semantic knowledge definition of different partners which are involved in a PLM application. The methodology has a special architecture for the functional refinement which links high semantic representation to geometric representation. To integrate the different know-how of a collaborative project, the parameter management is done by graphonumerical parameters (GNP) which dynamically connect trade knowledge to PLM applications.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents a development of the US Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) based on life-cycle concept of the Generalized Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology (GERAM) framework/ISO 15704:2000 requirements. Previous research has identified areas of concern within DoDAF by analyzing and evaluating DoDAF against GERAM and potentially assisting in its future development. This paper aims to extend existing architecture description process and artifacts within DoDAF that match the scope of the GERAM life-cycle phases. For this development we use life-cycle aspect of three well-known reference architectures (including PERA, CIMOSA, and GRAI-GIM) that were the basis in formation of GERAM.</abstract>

<abstract>Next generation manufacturing calls for mass customization of product fulfillment encompassing global and networked enterprises. This paper reports the development of an electronic configure-to-order platform for customized product development over the Internet. It aims to integrate different Web-based services across companies, as well as various lifecycle issues of product fulfillment, into a collaborative web of interactive commerce. A generic product family (GPF) master model is proposed to support product customization over the Internet while achieving a synergy of sales force automation, product design, manufacturing planning, and supply chain management within a coherent framework. Implementation of the configure-to-order platform is discussed in detail with a particular application to injection-molded parts.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents an, interactive, three-dimensional, Web-based and integrated e-Commerce system. This system enforces businesses to implement mass customization, through integration with product design environments on PDM/PLM systems. Through this system, consumers, partners or distributors, can take part in product design and get through their ideas, online and visually, to suppliers. With custom order information, suppliers produce or assembly to meet their customers’ demands as precisely and efficiently. We also developed a toolkit to configure the custom product and construct such an interactive website automatically through back PDM/PLM system. Several concerns on this system have been addressed, including its applicable business models, applied techniques, and implementation issues in product data processing, traffic-reduced transportation mechanism of three-dimensional product data, and three-dimensional interaction. A commercial e-Commerce system has been functional and ready for apparel, automobile and mobile phones.</abstract>

<abstract>Recent developments in business practices require companies to communicate frequently with each other. The use of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) documents is essential to ensure the integration of heterogeneous information systems. XML is widely used because of its platform-independence and the ability it offers to separate content from presentation. It is also used as a medium for form documents that are used over the flow of business processes. Recently most business processes have been managed by a software system, the Business Process Management (BPM) system. Change management of XML documents – recording and tracing the history of the documents – is important in e-business environments where multiple companies are involved. In this paper, we propose a new method of storing documents whereby changes are detected automatically and document versions are reconstructed upon user request. In addition, this method has allowed a model to recover documents even after a system error. A prototype system was implemented on top of a workflow system and an experiment was carried out to test the efficiency of our method. Our approach provides efficient storage and convenient management of documents.</abstract>

<abstract>Garment virtual design has been evolved significantly with the rapid development of 3D CAD tools, especially with the convenient availability of NURBS surface modeling capability. Parametric development of clothes is demanded in line with the trend of mass customization according to the true measures of customers or regulated sizes of certain markets. Virtual design features with well-defined associations with the parametric mannequins are enablers. To achieve an intelligent mass customization approach, the development of surface patches from 3D clothing designs to 2D flattened patterns become essential. This article addresses the definition, development and application of garment features with an associative feature approach.</abstract>

<abstract>The aim of the next generation of computer numerically controlled (CNC) machines is to be portable, interoperable and adaptable. Over the years, G-codes (ISO 6983) have been extensively used by the CNC machine tools for part programming and are now considered as a bottleneck for developing next generation of CNC machines. A new standard known as STEP-NC is being developed as the data model for a new breed of CNC machine tools. The data model represents a common standard specifically aimed at the intelligent CNC manufacturing workstation, making the goal of a standardised CNC controller and NC code generation facility a reality. It is believed that CNC machines implementing STEP-NC will be the basis for a more open and adaptable architecture. This paper outlines a futuristic view of STEP-NC to support distributed interoperable intelligent manufacturing through global networking with autonomous manufacturing workstations with STEP compliant data interpretation, intelligent part program generation, diagnostics and maintenance, monitoring and job production scheduling.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents a prototype object-oriented intelligent disassembly sequence planner for maintenance. A novel disassembly representation scheme known as disassembly constraint graph (DCG) has been proposed and implemented as a prototype system in this work. Using the DCG, all the possible disassembly operations that are needed for the maintenance of certain components or subassemblies can be deduced. Subsequently, a sequence-based optimisation technique, genetic algorithms, is employed to generate near optimal disassembly sequence from all the feasible combination of these disassembly operations. Based on the DCG, an object-oriented intelligent disassembly sequence planner for maintenance has been developed. The prototype system comprises three modules each having a set of objects. Users are able to view the entire disassembly process in accordance to the near optimal sequence generated by the planner via a graphical user interface. Two case studies, which are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the planner, are presented.</abstract>

<abstract>Recent advance of mobile and interactive devices, such as smart phones, PDAs, and handheld computers, enables to deliver multimodal contents based on users and their environments. In pervasive computing, multimodal contents are mainly composed of multiple components which are often delivered from distributed multiple sources. Therefore, how appropriate contents can be provided to users and how computing resources can be effectively exploited are critical issues. In this paper, an analytical model for multimodal contents is developed based on a queueing theory for the purpose of delivery evaluation of the contents. The model can be applied to estimate how delivery parameters of multimodal contents, such as arrival rates, drop rates, and the number of packets, can impact overall the quality of services in terms of temporal aspects. A numerical example of weather information delivery is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper examines the problem of determining the sequence in which to cast aluminium ingots such that setup times are minimized. The aluminium ingots are of different size and consist of different alloys; this poses constraints on the allowable ordering of casting jobs. The sequencing problem can be formulated as an asymmetric traveling salesman problem with additional constraints. Two different methods are used to formulate and solve this problem, a genetic algorithm (GA) and an integer programming approach (IP). A new method for detecting sub-tours in the IP formulation is set forth and used. Both the GA and IP approach are implemented in a software tool that is being used in the aluminium production industry. The results show that even though the integer programming formulation can be used to solve the problem to optimality, the size of the problem is a limiting factor for practical implementation. Therefore, the genetic algorithm is used in the industrial implementation with good results.</abstract>

<abstract>With the industrial products competition, reliability, maintainability and safety are key characteristics for availability improvement. This is mainly true in industries like automotive, aeronautic, or NC machines tools. Therefore, it is crucial to predict these characteristics as soon as possible before the manufacturing starts. This paper presents an approach to provide indicators for maintainability and safety prediction at early stage of design. The assessment procedure uses the product CAD 3D model and an associated semantic matrix gathering information on the product components criticality and reliability. Using this information we calculate indicators for the product maintainability and safety. An academic application is developed to illustrate our approach and point out the interaction between maintainability and safety constraints to determine suitable solution. In conclusion, we state on possible extensions of this approach for evaluating other product lifecycle characteristics and we give guidelines on the implementation aspects.</abstract>

<abstract>Product lifecycle stages are inter-related and mutually constraining. Due to the sequential nature of the product development processes, some constraints or conflicts may emerge in a later stage and require modifications to the decisions made in earlier stages. The iterations between stages are hence unavoidable and must be managed carefully to maintain the consistency, integrity and validity of product information models. Due to the inter- or intra-stage relations, a chain of changes is very likely to occur as the consequence of an initial change. Modeling and maintaining these relations are important in collaborative engineering to evolve the state of the whole product model in a consistent manner. This paper introduces a new method of modeling associative engineering relations in a unified feature modeling scheme and elaborates a change propagation algorithm for the information consistency control among multiple applications of product lifecycle stages. The algorithm is established on a JTMS-based dependency network. Two case studies are used to illustrate the proposed dependency network and change propagation algorithm.</abstract>

<title>An intelligent benchmark-based design for environment system for derivative electronic product development.</title>

<abstract>In recent years, the destruction of the ecological environment and the exhaustion of natural resources have become increasingly severe. The demand for environmental protection has attracted worldwide attention. If a company cannot address changes in ecological law, its products will no longer have access to world markets. For this reason, companies should introduce the concept of design for environment (DfE) to the product development process to alleviate the impacts of a product on the ecological environment throughout the product life cycle. To help companies effectively meet the challenges cited above, this study develops an intelligent benchmark-based DfE system for derivative electronic products. The architecture of the intelligent system includes three parts. In the first part, a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is used to create the analysis of approximate life cycle inventory (LCI). The first part is utilised to estimate the amounts of hazardous chemical substances produced by the material extraction, manufacturing and usage phases as well as the amounts of energy consumed by the production and usage phases. In the second part, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is applied to develop the models of benchmark-based DfE evaluation for a product and a component or part. The models are used to identify which hazardous chemical substances are excessive and to calculate the needed reductions in the quantities of these hazardous chemical substances. The third part of the intelligent DfE system is used to generate analysis and suggestions for improvement in the design of parts or components. The analysis and suggestion model utilises the second-part analytical results and a BPNN to identify concrete directions for improvement and to generate suggestions that can be used to achieve the ultimate goal of DfE.</abstract>

<abstract>Classical approaches for remote visualization and collaboration used in Computer-Aided Design and Engineering (CAD/E) applications are no longer appropriate due to the increasing amount of data generated, especially using standard networks. We introduce a lightweight and computing platform for scientific simulation, collaboration in engineering, 3D visualization and big data management. This ICT based platform provides scientists an “easy-to-integrate” generic tool, thus enabling worldwide collaboration and remote processing for any kind of data. The service-oriented architecture is based on the cloud computing paradigm and relies on standard internet technologies to be efficient on a large panel of networks and clients. In this paper, we discuss the need of innovations in (i) pre and post processing visualization services, (ii) 3D large scientific data set scalable compression and transmission methods, (iii) collaborative virtual environments, and (iv) collaboration in multi-domains of CAD/E. We propose our open platform for collaborative simulation and scientific big data analysis. This platform is now available as an open project with all core components licensed under LGPL V2.1. We provide two examples of usage of the platform in CAD/E for sustainability engineering from one academic application and one industrial case study. Firstly, we consider chemical process engineering showing the development of a domain specific service. With the rise of global warming issues and with growing importance granted to sustainable development, chemical process engineering has turned to think more and more environmentally. Indeed, the chemical engineer has now taken into account not only the engineering and economic criteria of the process, but also its environmental and social performances. Secondly, an example of natural hazards management illustrates the efficiency of our approach for remote collaboration that involves big data exchange and analysis between distant locations. Finally we underline the platform benefits and we open our platform through next activities in innovation techniques and inventive design.</abstract>

<abstract>Business strategy is currently largely defined by the way that an organisation interacts with its stanapproach for supporting new product introduction (NPI) investments. The proposed methodology combines the existing concepts of directional policy matrix and real options are combined to establish the novel real options matrix (ROM) that enables strategic decisions regarding NPI. ROM consists of nine regions based on company's competitive capabilities and business sector prospects. To address the fuzzy boundaries between the ROM regions a fuzzy expert system is developed and validated based on a historical case study of a petrochemical industry. The results indicate that ROM can provide a reliable guide within the particular context as the strategy that the company followed matched with the ROM recommendation. The results are encouraging and support further consideration of ROM regarding NPI decisions.</abstract>

<abstract>Determining the optimal layout of an intermodal terminal network, more specifically the optimal locations of the terminals, is a complicated matter that requires adequate decision support tools. In this paper, a bi-objective model is developed, minimizing both the transportation cost for the users of the terminal network, as well as the location cost for the terminal operators. A problem-specific GRASP (greedy randomized adaptive search procedure) is developed to solve the bi-objective terminal location problem efficiently. The algorithm only has a single parameter, that determines the allowed calculation time and can be used to improve the quality of the Pareto set approximation.</abstract>

<abstract>Function structure is a popular product design approach in the mechanical design world. However, it does not currently provide an object-oriented design method for design of a product's software system. Also, function structure is limited in identifying supporting mechanisms for individual physical components. The proposed integrated function structure and object-oriented design framework improves the function structure approach, and provides methods of generating variant and common components for the product family. This framework integrates the function structure, object model, and system architecture to explore the development of products requiring the interplay of physical and software elements concurrently. Many classes of products could benefit from this approach. We present in this paper a virtual prototyping tool for conceptual design leveraging on the proposed framework and demonstrating its usage and advantages.</abstract>

<abstract>We analyze a new tandem system in which items are transported through a sequence of stations from an origin to a destination via a series of vehicles that move back and forth between consecutive stations. Each pair of consecutive stations is connected by a single vehicle with unit capacity that travels back and forth between the upstream and downstream station. Each vehicle travels with an item in the downstream direction and without an item in the upstream direction. The stations act as holding areas for items awaiting further transport within the system. Stations may have non-identical capacities. We model this system as a continuous time Markov chain and develop a recursive algorithm for generating the state transition matrix. After solving for the steady state probabilities using the Gauss–Seidel method, we compute the average throughput rate, average number of items in the system, and average sojourn time for various system configurations.</abstract>

<abstract>Interoperability has been mainly approached from an IT point of view or enterprise collaboration perspective. This paper aims at contributing to develop a science base for interoperability by studying interoperability on the basis of the system theory. The main contribution is to propose a formalisation of interoperability grounded in the general system theory: the Ontology of Interoperability (OoI). OoI provides a meta-model for ontological descriptions of systems, problems and solutions, which can then be inferred for a computer-aided interoperability diagnosis and problem solving. Related concepts definitions as well as a systemic model and a decisional model are given and discussed. Based on the Framework for Enterprise Interoperability (CEN/ISO 11354), the specialisation of the OoI to the enterprise domain is discussed. A case example is presented to illustrate the proposed approach.</abstract>

<abstract>Flexible manufacturing and customization has long been a topic in modern manufacturing society. However, challenges still remain on the responsiveness of production system to the fluctuation of market demand. In this paper, we developed a data driven simulation methodology to automatically model a production system and rapidly modify the model corresponding to dynamic requirements and real time information. This methodology provides a “rapid prototyping” capability for production system modeling and enables a quick analyzing and remodeling capability to respond to the fluctuation of demands. The approach is developed and applied to an automotive general assembly plant with an online material handling system. A complete information model based on IDEF1X is constructed for this domain specific modeling and simulation. The main simulation modules for assembly line and material handling system of the plant floor are analyzed and a simulator is implemented in ARENA by SIMAN/VBA program. The case study of an automotive assembly plant shows that the data driven approach enables the modeling and simulation of the complex assembly plant in a “real-time” fashion and therefore effectively improve the responsiveness and flexibility of the production line.</abstract>

<title>A matrix-based modularization approach for supporting secure collaboration in parametric design.</title>

<volume>63</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>The purpose of this paper is to develop a matrix-based modularization method that protects critical product information from being known by suppliers. The product information is first captured by a function–parameter (FP) matrix, which defines the dependency relationships between functions and parameters. In addition, two types of parameters are classified: shared and protected. The shared parameters are the parameters to be known by the suppliers for collaborative design, while the protected parameters are assumed to be the confidential product information. Given the FP matrix with shared and protected parameters, a three-phase clustering method is proposed to form product modules that intentionally group and isolate protected parameters. Based on a matrix-based modular structure, a formulation is proposed to estimate the leakage risk of protected parameters due to the disclosure of shared parameters to suppliers. At the end, the relief valve system is used to examine the proposed modularization and measurement methods.</abstract>

<number>8-9</number>
<abstract>Ports globally face considerable challenges ranging from efficiency in operations to security threats. These call for research on innovative solutions with minimal reliance on manual interventions and controls. This paper discusses the design and operation of an intelligent model of a port. The model is designed based on the challenges, experiences and operations of the port of Mombasa. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is central to the model in enabling intelligence. The embedded intelligence includes: what is entering or has entered the port; what is in the port; what is leaving or has left the port; legal (authorized) and illegal (un-authorized) transactions and movements; and, health and risk status of the cargo. Remedial measures are instituted upon observation of violations or deviations together with alert generation on violations or whenever set thresholds are exceeded that are then sent to relevant persons or agencies as defined in the system. The basis of the intelligent model, design, working operations and supporting technologies are presented. Simulations of the model are undertaken for movement of goods from arrival at the port to release using four simulations. Details of the simulation design and results are presented. An evaluation of the model and how it addresses the challenges currently being experienced are provided. Finally, the benefits of implementation, limitations and likely direction of the future are enumerated.</abstract>

<abstract>The notion of an intelligent product places suitability for integration firmly on the research agenda. Indeed, this paradigm aims for coordination and integration on a scale that is unseen until today. Note that this applies particularly where it concerns the core businesses of companies. For that reason, this paper presents a novel concept, the intelligent being, as a vehicle to achieve suitability for integration. The concept is applied to intelligent product instances, intelligent product types and intelligent resources alike. The paper identifies: (1) which services and functionalities can be offered by intelligent beings, (2) what are suitable candidate intelligent beings, and what are not. The paper shows that intelligent beings can reflect a corresponding reality – a product – in its current, past and future states. It thus argues for a role of the intelligent being that is analogous to what maps contribute in navigation systems (and may become as important).</abstract>

<abstract>Design for manufacturing (DFM) approaches aim to integrate manufacturability aspects during the design stage. Most of DFM approaches usually consider only one manufacturing process, but product competitiveness may be improved by designing hybrid modular products, in which products are seen as 3-D puzzles with modules realized individually by the best manufacturing process and further gathered. A new DFM system is created in order to give quantitative information during the product design stage of which modules will benefit in being machined and which ones will advantageously be realized by an additive process (such as Selective Laser Sintering or laser deposition). A methodology for a manufacturability evaluation in case of a subtractive or an additive manufacturing process is developed and implemented in a CAD software. Tests are carried out on industrial products from automotive industry.</abstract>

<abstract>The aim of this study is to accelerate new product introduction and to improve the quality of decision-making in new product development (NPD) process under uncertain conditions. We first present the uncertainty factors related to NPD and also give existing decision-making techniques that help the decision makers to reduce their risks under uncertainty. Basically, we are interested in two stages of new product decision-making: the choice of a new product idea (“go”/“no go” decision) and the choice of the right implementation order of the selected product ideas. To achieve this, we propose an integrated approach based on fuzzy logic, neural networks and multi criteria decision-making to make the most appropriate decisions. By utilizing artificial intelligent techniques, we manage to accelerate the selection process. Finally, a case study in a toy manufacturing firm is given to demonstrate the potential of the methodology.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper makes four main contributions towards managing large collections of process models. First, we show how flexible process variants can be configured by applying rules to a generic process template using a configuration algorithm. This leads to a separation of control flow and business policy. Second, we develop a new succinct representation for process trees as strings by performing a post-order traversal. This structure can facilitate process variant configuration and retrieval. Third, we develop techniques for querying a repository of process variants by means of bit vectors. In this way the management of variants even in a large repository is greatly enhanced. Finally, we describe a preliminary implementation of our approach with a case study for demonstration. Our focus is on capturing deeper process knowledge and achieving a holistic approach to robust process design, as well as ease of accommodating changes to business policy.</abstract>

<title>Batching orders in warehouses by minimizing travel distance with genetic algorithms.</title>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>The power of warehousing system to rapidly respond to customer demands participates an important function in the success of supply chain. Before picking the customer orders, effectively consolidating orders into batches can significantly speed the product movement within a warehouse. There is considerable product movement within a warehouse; the warehousing costs can be reduced by even a small percentage of reduction in the picking distance. The order batching problem is recognized to be NP-hard, and it is extremely difficult to obtain optimal solutions for large-scale problems within a tolerable computation time. Previous studies have mainly focused on the order batching problems in warehouses with a single-aisle and two-dimension layout. This study develops an order batching approach based on genetic algorithms (GAs) to deal with order batching problems with any kind of batch structure and any kind of warehouse layout. Unlike to previous batching methods, the proposed approach, additionally, does not require the computation of order/batch proximity and the estimation of travel distance. The proposed GA-based order batching method, namely GABM, directly minimizes the total travel distance. The potential of applying GABM for solving medium- and large-scale order batching problems is also investigated by using several examples. From the batching results, the proposed GABM approach appears to obtain quality solutions in terms of travel distance and facility utilization.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper explores two major interdisciplinary techniques facilitating mass customization strategies—e-commerce and knowledge management. The linkages between the two serve to validate the strategic shift toward mass customization. Internet-enabled e-commerce provides capabilities for firms to reach global buyers and suppliers and is increasingly recognized as a way to support the gathering of knowledge, specifically customer preferences. Knowledge management provides frameworks needed to manage intellectual capital as a valuable organizational resource for supporting customized preferences. Knowledge management makes mass customization a more viable strategy for manufacturers as they work to meet changing customer needs and desires. This article posits the linkage between e-commerce and knowledge management can support firms as they gather customer preferences and evaluate the data to advance mass customization. A profile for firms to assess their readiness for mass customization, specifically considering available knowledge management and e-commerce linkages, is provided along with areas for future research.</abstract>

<abstract>This article deals with problems related to the integration of reverse logistics activities within an organization and to the coordination of this new system. Reverse logistics activities refer to the recovery and processing of unused products and to the redistribution of reusable materials. For better control and management of these activities, new approaches and information support system are proposed here. A new organizational system, which represents the course of the operational processes and the management of the organization's resources (labor, material, etc.), and an information system architecture are proposed for a rehabilitation center.</abstract>

<abstract>Data formats and e-business frameworks are important standards for e-business. The ASC X12, EDIFACT and XML formats are utilized in e-business frameworks which are supported in information systems. The EDI formats have retained a position in cross-industry-document e-business frameworks, whereas the XML format dominates in cross-industry-process e-business frameworks and has gained a footing in industry-specific e-business frameworks. The use of XML-based e-business frameworks has increased more than the use of EDI-based e-business frameworks in 2004. XML-based e-business frameworks are more widely used in the new market economies and EDI-based e-business frameworks in the old market economies. XML-based e-business frameworks are more common in the industries for which there exists an XML-based but no EDI-based industry-specific e-business framework. In other industries, EDI-based e-business frameworks are more common. This paper also discusses a lock-in to the EDI formats and EDI-based e-business frameworks.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper details the development of an automated vision-based solution for identification of paint and substrate defects on painted slates. The developed vision system consists of two major components. The first component of the system addresses issues including the mechanical implementation and interfacing the inspection system with the sensing and optical equipment. The second component involves the development of an image processing algorithm that is able to identify the visual defects present on the slate surface. The process of imaging the slate proved to be very challenging as the slate surface is darkly coloured and presents depth non-uniformities. Hence, a key issue for this inspection system was to devise an adequate illumination system that was able to accommodate challenges including the slates’ surface depth non-uniformities and vibrations generated by the conveying system. The visual defects are detected using a novel texture analysis solution where the greyscale (tonal characteristics) and texture information are embedded in a composite model. The developed inspection system was tested for robustness and experimental results are presented.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper describes the use of item dwell-time measurement in the context of capital investment projects. It contributes to the research on product-centric control and intelligent products by empirically demonstrating the value of item dwell-time alerts in the context of project delivery. The paper shows how item dwell-time measurement can be implemented in the field, and compares item dwell-time alerts to conventional measures of inventory turnover and inventory value in four telecommunications infrastructure projects. We find that when individual items cannot be used interchangeably at project sites, conventional inventory measures do not provide sufficiently timely and accurate information about emerging problems in project inventories. These findings are especially important in situations in which supply chain managers can find alternative uses for materials at other sites or in other projects. Timely reallocation of materials prevents the accumulation of slow-moving items that weigh on project performance by increasing obsolescence and inventory holding costs.</abstract>

<abstract>Ontologies are rapidly becoming popular in various research fields. There is a tendency both in converting existing models into ontologies and in creating new models. In this work we are focusing on Closed-Loop Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) models. An ontology model of a Product Data and Knowledge Management Semantic Object Model for PLM has been developed, with the aim of implementing ontology advantages and features into the model. An initial effort of developing the model into an ontology using Web Ontology Language-Description Logic (OWL-DL) is described in detail and the background and the motives for converting existing PLM models to ontologies is provided. The new model facilitates several of the OWL-DL capabilities, while maintaining previously achieved characteristics. Furthermore, a case study is presented based on application scenarios on the automotive industry. This case study deals with data integration and interoperability problems, in which a significant number of reasoning capabilities is implemented.</abstract>

<number>4</number>
<abstract>Digital methods of planning and validation enable production planning not only to plan technological processes and equipment, but also to ensure the product's producability in early phases and to influence product design from a production point of view. The concept of Digital Planning Validation (DPV) as presented here is based on a process paralleling that of digital planning. It comprises both the continuous checking of digital planning results as well as process reviews at certain points in time, the so-called Process Days. During these, the current planning states are validated through geometrical checks of the assemblies, the simulation of processes or detailed examinations of layouts. The method of Digital Planning Validation is based on DMU techniques and simulation. Analogous to the product DMU in development, it can be regarded as a kind of process DMU of production planning within the Digital Factory. The main advantages of Digital Planning Validation are the increased security and reliability when planning is realized, a better quality of planning results, and a higher degree of product maturity during the early planning phases.</abstract>

<abstract>The paper presents an architecture for adaptive fuzzy control of industrial systems. Both conventional and adaptive fuzzy control can be designed. The control methodology can integrate a priori knowledge about the control and/or about the plant, with on-line control adaptation mechanisms to cope with time-varying and/or uncertain plant parameters. The paper presents the fuzzy control software architecture that can be integrated in industrial processing and communication structures. It includes four distinct modules: a mathematical fuzzy library, a graphical user interface (GUI), fuzzy controller, and industrial communication. Three types of adaptive fuzzy control methods have been studied, and compared: (1) direct adaptive, (2) indirect adaptive, and (3) combined direct/indirect adaptive. An experimental benchmark composed of two mechanically coupled electrical DC motors has been employed to study the performance of the presented control architectures. The first motor acts as an actuator, while the second motor is used to generate nonlinearities and/or time-varying load. Results indicate that all tested controllers have good performance in overcoming changes of DC motor load.</abstract>

<abstract>Collaborative product development is becoming more valuable because of the increasing coordination and management complexity of organizational information, responsibilities, schedules, deliverables, product information, and business process. As outsourcing and globalization increase the number of design chain participants, a collaborative product development speeds up the decision-making of trusted partners, employees, suppliers, and customers in design chains. Due to continuous changes in design projects, delays in product developments are common. Thus, a change control workflow is needed among design chain participants for product development. A distributed change control workflow for design network is therefore proposed in this study. This type of workflow is a two-layer approach derived from the principles of configuration management and routing algorithm. It has been validated that the consistencies of designs from each participants in design chain is maintained by applying the proposed distributed change control workflow.</abstract>

<abstract>Information technology (IT) could be an important tool for reaching efficiency and effectiveness within maintenance, provided that correct and relevant IT is applied. In this paper, a conceptual model for identifying maintenance management IT requirements is developed, with its practical application in a process for the IT requirements identification for maintenance management. The process is exemplified in two real-world cases. This paper suggests that the factors of goals, purpose and use should be considered on organisational and individual level in order to identify the IT demands. Correct level of IT applied, i.e. IT consisting of correct functionality required for planning, conducting and following up maintenance activities according to the state of maintenance and the strategy adapted, will contribute to successful maintenance management. Moreover, this paper promotes the use of a structured procedure for the identification of IT requirements for maintenance management.</abstract>

<abstract>The need for increased levels of reuse and remanufacturing is driving the need for sustainable design of remanufactured products. It is acknowledged that design for remanufacturing benefits the environment. However, it seldom integrates eco-design approaches as it requires ‘life cycle thinking’ with closed-loop life cycles. The objective of this paper is to support eco-design of remanufactured products with design process and data models structuring the activities to be performed and providing the support required. We consider the development of two activities in particular: definition of the target, and environmental analysis. The first activity exploits the concept of RPP (Remanufacturable Product Profile), building on the criteria that are crucial for a successful remanufactured product. The second one exploits the life cycle brick concept that associates each product component with a specific life cycle and related environmental impacts. The models proposed are exploited in a case study concerning the design of remanufactured truck gearboxes.</abstract>

<abstract>Collaborative Product Development (CPD) across enterprises has been recognized as an effective strategy to connect multi-enterprise wide project teams to develop more competitive products. Process management is vital to the successful implementation of CPD in a multi-enterprise environment. In this paper, a novel Web Services (WSs) and process-view combined approach has been developed to manage the dynamic and distributed process of CPD to enhance the workflow interoperability among heterogeneous Workflow Management Systems (WMSs) of enterprises. Meanwhile, a hybrid P2P based WMSs framework has been built to provide an open and scalable architecture to deploy inter-enterprises collaboration. A software prototype system has been implemented using the open JXTA platform, and the collaborative development of a motorcycle has been used as a test case to validate the proposed approach and the prototype system.</abstract>

<abstract>Advanced manufacturing systems need to be developed for enterprises to cooperate with each other in order to survive in the increasingly competitive global market. In this paper, manufacturing management issues are addressed at three levels: virtual enterprise (inter-enterprise), enterprise (intra-enterprise) and shop floor levels. An Internet enabled framework based on Web Services and agents for cooperative manufacturing management is proposed. An integration environment consisting of an agent based scheduling system, a Web based remote monitoring and control system, and corresponding services is designed and developed for the management, monitoring and control of the shop floor. Implementation details of the shop floor management environment are presented and some future work is prospected.</abstract>

<abstract>To register 3D meshes representing smooth surfaces we track the 3D digitization system using photogrammetric techniques and calibrations. We present an example by digitizing a 800 mm × 600 mm portion of a car door. To increase the tracking accuracy the 3D scanner is placed in a cubic frame of side 0.5 m covered with 78 targets. The target frame moves in a volume that is approximately 1100 mm × 850 mm × 900 mm, to digitize the area of interest. Using four cameras this target frame is tracked with of an accuracy of 0.03 mm spatially and 0.180 mrad angularly. A registration accuracy between 0.1 mm and 2 mm is reached. This method can be used for the registration of meshes representing featureless surfaces.</abstract>

<abstract>A repository and a distributed architecture for enterprise modeling components (EMC) are proposed. The components are used by enterprise designers to (re)engineer particular business models. Each component represents a chunk of business knowledge on some parts of an enterprise or of some enterprise network. The repository ensures that enterprise components can be shared by the actors of the enterprise network. The meta-model that supports these models is formalized using enterprise modeling language constructs (i.e., CIMOSA business concepts). The paper presents a distributed client/server architecture to support the approach for which business servers, applications servers and client systems are discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>The product design process plays a central role in ensuring that new products are realized with improved quality, in a short lead-time and with costs kept to a minimum. Designing the design process is an essential ingredient to ensure sustained competitiveness of a company. The collaborative nature of today's product development environment complicates the design of design processes. In this paper, it is proposed that design outsourcing and collaboration decisions should form a critical component of modeling and synthesizing collaborative design processes. An approach to modeling collaborative design processes is proposed based on the use of design nodes. The approach allows an ongoing design process to be modeled facilitating dynamic decision making on how the design process should progress accounting for the state of the design problem, design process factors, collaboration and design outsourcing factors.</abstract>

<abstract>The advance and pervasive applications of the Web-enabled computations are exerting a profound influence on product design and manufacturing processes, and one of the major technical shifts for product development systems is toward supporting distributed collaboration. A key component for this trend is to develop a service model that enables product development systems to be triggered and manipulated from a remote computer, so as to provide a more flexible manner to share and interoperate the executive codes and processing data. In this paper, a process planning optimization module has been wrapped as a Web-enabled service and deployed in the Internet to support distributed design and manufacturing analysis. The module consists of several optimization approaches, and a Tabu search-based approach, which can optimize the selection of machining resources, determination of set-up plans and sequencing of machining operations to achieve optimal process plans, is elaborated to illustrate the process. The Web-based service has been integrated with a distributed feature-based design system, and the latter can generate design models and re-represent them in an XML representation based on VRML and attributes of features to provide the input of the former. Through effective utilization of the Web and Java technologies, the established service and relevant system can be used by a distributed design team to organize concurrent engineering activities effectively.</abstract>

<abstract>Information retrieval (IR) is a well-established research and development area. Document formats such as SGML (Standard Generalised Mark-up Language) and XML (eXtensible Mark-up Language) have become widely used in recent years. Traditional IR systems demonstrate limitations when dealing with such documents, which motivated the emergence of structured document retrieval (SDR) technology intending to overcome these limitations. This paper reviews the work carried out from the inception to the development and application of SDR in engineering document management. The key issues of SDR are discussed and the state of the art of SDR to improve information access performance has been surveyed. A comparison of selected papers is provided and possible future research directions identified. The paper concludes with the expectation that SDR will make a positive impact on the process of engineering document management from document construction to its delivery in the future, and undoubtedly provide better information retrieval performance in terms of both precision and functionality.</abstract>

<abstract>The immersive virtual reality (VR) for manufacturing planning helps to cut down the product development period and to improve the quality of the production. However, the immersive VR equipments are generally expensive, both in terms of development and buying. Users spend time to manually repair complex 3D shapes because of imperfect translations between 3D engineering CAD models and the proprietary format of the VR system. In this paper, the proposed VR module uses a commercial virtual manufacturing system (VMS) as the viewer of the immersive VR system on a cluster of PCs and adopts the modified simulation algorithm. The module can make the data translation process unnecessary and ensure good coherence under simulation. At experiment, the proposed immersive VR module was interfaced with the Delmia VMS. Its clustering modules can reduce the cost of VR experiment while offering high performance.</abstract>

<title>A hybrid and adaptive tool-path generation approach of rapid prototyping and manufacturing for biomedical models.</title>

<abstract>In this paper, a hybrid and adaptive tool-path generation approach, which is able to improve geometrical accuracy and build time of rapid prototyping/manufacturing (RP/M) for complex biomedical models, is presented. Firstly, NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline)-based curves were introduced to represent the boundary contours of sliced layers to keep the high-fidelity information of original models. Secondly, a hybrid tool-path generation algorithm was then developed to generate contour and zigzag tool-paths. The contour tool-paths are used to fabricate the boundary and neighbouring regions of each sliced layer to preserve geometrical accuracy, and zigzag tool-paths for the internal region of the layer to simplify computing processes and speed up fabrication. Thirdly, based on developed build time and geometrical accuracy analysis models, algorithms were designed to generate an adaptive speed of the RP/M's nozzle/print head for the contour tool-paths to address the geometrical characteristics of each layer, and to identify the best slope degree of the zigzag tool-paths towards achieving the minimum build time. Finally, five case studies of biomedical models with different geometrical characteristics and complexity were used to verify and demonstrate the improved performance of the approach in terms of processing effectiveness, geometrical accuracy and algorithm robustness.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper, we propose a novel integrated framework combining association rule mining, case-based-reasoning and text mining that can be used to continuously improve service and repair in an automotive domain. The developed framework enables identification of anomalies in the field that cause customer dissatisfaction and performs root cause investigation of the anomalies. It also facilitates identification of the best practices in the field and learning from these best practices to achieve lean and effective service. Association rule mining is used for the anomaly detection and the root cause investigation, while case-based-reasoning in conjunction with text mining is used to learn from the best practices. The integrated system is implemented in a web based distributed architecture and has been tested on real life data.</abstract>

<abstract>Collision detection by machining simulation requires the 3D models of rotating cutters. However, the 3D models of a cutter and holder are not always available. In this paper, a new method is proposed to design an automatic vision-based 3D modeling system, which is able to quickly reconstruct the 3D model of a cutter and holder when they are installed onto the spindle. Only a single camera is mounted on the machine tool to capture the image of the rotating cutter and holder. By viewing the rotating cutter and holder as an object of surface of revolution, the contour of the imaged cutter and holder can be used to reconstruct the 3D model as a stack of circular cross-sections. Then the complete generating function of the cutter and holder can be recovered from the cross-sections. Finally, the 3D model of the cutter is built by rotating the generating function around the spindle axis. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method are verified by experiments on-machine using 12 kinds of cutters and holders, which can satisfy the requirement of collision detection.</abstract>

<abstract>The importance of greenhouse construction in some parts of the south-east of Spain has led to the creation of a European Standard for the design and construction of greenhouses for commercial production (UNE-EN 13031-1). The design process of a tunnel greenhouse can be viewed as the construction of object-oriented programs. The idea behind this approach is to incorporate the characteristic of reusability into the greenhouse design process: this characteristic naturally reduces the cost of design of new programs, since the design costs are measured in time and the number of errors made and rectified. In this paper, we demonstrate modeling using object-oriented techniques (OOT) based upon standard UML and XML notations for simulating multitunnel greenhouses. These techniques facilitate identification of the actors involved, their roles, functions, interaction protocols and behavior. Some examples include the processes of greenhouse marketing, calculation of interdependencies and decomposition between the greenhouse structures.</abstract>

<title>A performance-based structural policy for conflict-free routing of bi-directional automated guided vehicles.</title>

<abstract>Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) play an important role in flexible manufacturing systems. One of the key issues of using AGVs is the conflict-free routing especially when the AGV system is bi-directional. Two classes of routing algorithms have been proposed in the literature: Optimised pre-planning algorithms, and Real-time routing algorithms. Pre-planning algorithm present the advantage of producing optimal conflict-free routes, but do not deal with changing situations such as vehicle delays and failures. Real-time algorithms present the advantage of being reactive, but are non-optimal. In this paper, we propose to combine the advantages of both. We use a two-stage approach: In the first control stage, a pre-planning method to establish the fastest conflict-free routes for AGVs. In the second stage, conflicts are avoided in a real-time manner when needed. The objective of this last is the avoidance of deadlocks in presence of interruptions while maintaining the established AGVs’ routes. Two robust routing algorithms are presented. The efficiency of our approach is analysed using developed simulations.</abstract>

For two foundries manufacturing the same alloy and cast geometry, the process and alloy conditions used by one foundry will most likely be different from the other one. For a foundry process engineer, it is also currently difficult to link process knowledge available in the published literature to specific process conditions and defects in a foundry.</abstract>

<abstract>A technical product can have hundreds of requirements, resulting in a resource consuming requirement processes. Requirements are therefore becoming a valuable knowledge. Requirement reuse has been recognized as a promising enabler to increase efficiency and quality of the requirement processes. Before documenting and reusing requirements there must be a defined way of organizing them. An efficient comprehension of the context of the requirement structure will support the usage of the structure and thus reuse of existing requirements. To understand what makes a structure qualified for requirement reuse; criterions for a good requirement structure were identified. A survey of current requirement structuring techniques revealed that the current methods only fulfil some but not all of the criterions. A proposal of a structure for a reusable requirement specification has been presented. It suggests a new way of grouping requirements and also utilizes techniques presented in some of the existing modelling methods. The proposal was applied to a product development project of Solar Inverters. The case study revealed that the proposed structure was well accepted by its users, remained stable between projects and supported reuse.</abstract>

<abstract>Modeling and representation of geometric tolerances information across an enterprise is viable due to the advances in Internet technologies and increasing integration requirements from industry. In Integrated Measurement Processes (IMP), geometric tolerances data model must support different models from several well-defined standards: including ASME Y14.5M-1994, STEP, DMIS and others. In this paper, we propose a layered conformance level geometric tolerances representation model. This model uses the widely applied ASME Y14.5M-1994 as its foundation layer by abstracting most information from this standard. The additional geometric tolerances information defined by DMIS and STEP is incorporated into this model to form corresponding conformance layers that support IMP. Thus, different application domains in an enterprise can use this data model to exchange product information. This model is further transformed with XML Schema that can be used to generate XML instance file to satisfy geometric tolerances representation requirements in IMP.</abstract>

<title>Modeling and evaluating information leakage caused by inferences in supply chains.</title>
<pages>351-363</pages>
<year>2011</year>
<volume>62</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>While information sharing can benefit supply chains significantly, it may also have an adverse effect, namely, information leakage. A limitation common to many existing solutions for preventing information leakage in supply chains is that they rely, either implicitly or explicitly, upon two unrealistic assumptions. First, what information is confidential is well known. Second, confidential information will not be revealed, if only it is not shared, regardless of how much other information is being shared. As we shall show in this paper, those assumptions are not always true due to potential information leakage caused by inferences. Specifically, we propose a conceptual model of such information leakage. The model will enable companies in a supply chain to better understand how their confidential information may be leaked through inferences. On the basis of the proposed conceptual model, we then devise a quantitative approach to evaluating the risk of information leakage caused by inferences when a given amount of information is shared. The quantitative approach will allow companies in a supply chain to measure and consequently mitigate the risk of information leakage. Finally, we discuss a case study to illustrate how the proposed approaches work in practice.</abstract>

<abstract>Measurement, inspection and quality control in industry have benefited from 3D techniques for imaging and visualization in recent years. The development of machine vision devices at decreased costs, as well as their miniaturization and integration in industrial processes, have accelerated the use of 3D imaging systems in industry. In this paper we describe how to improve the performance of a 3D imaging system for inline dimensional quality inspection of long, flat-rolled metal products manufactured in rolling mills we designed and developed in previous works. Two dimensional characteristics of rolled products are measured by the system: width and flatness. The system is based on active triangulation using a single-line pattern projected onto the surface of the product under inspection for range image acquisition. Taking the system calibration into account the range images are transformed into a calibrated point cloud representing the 3D surface reconstruction of the product. Two approaches to improve the line detection and extraction method used in the original system are discussed, one intended for high-speed processing with lower accuracy, and the other providing high accuracy while incurring higher computational time expenses. A mechanism to remove, or at least reduce, the effects of product movements while manufacturing, such as bouncing and flapping, is also proposed to improve the performance of the system.</abstract>

<volume>60</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>Proposed in this paper is a novel approach to virtual prototyping of digital handheld products using augmented reality (AR)-based tangible interaction and functional behavior simulation. For tangible user interaction in an AR environment, we use two types of tangible objects: one is for a product, and the other is for a pointer. The user can create input events by touching specified regions of the product-type tangible object with the pointer-type tangible object. Rapid prototyping and paper-based modeling are adopted to fabricate the AR-based tangible objects which play an important role in improving the accuracy and tangibility of user interaction. For functional behavior simulation, we adopt a state transition methodology to capture the functional behavior of the product into an information model, and build a finite state machine (FSM) to control the transition between states of the product based on the information model. The FSM is combined with the AR-based tangible objects whose operations in the AR environment facilitate the tangible interaction, realistic visualization and functional simulation of a digital handheld product. Based on the proposed approach, a prototyping system has been developed and applied for the design evaluation of various digital handheld products with encouraging feedback from users.</abstract>

<abstract>Managing risk has become a critical component of supply chain management. The implications of supply chain failures can be costly and lead to significant customer delivery delays. Though, different types of supply chain vulnerability management methodologies have been proposed for managing supply risk, most offer only point-based solutions that deal with a limited set of risks. This research aims to reinforce inbound supply chain risk management by proposing an integrated methodology to classify, manage and assess inbound supply risks. The contributions of this paper are four-fold: (1) inbound supply risk factors are identified through both an extensive academic literature review on supply risk literature review as well as a series of industry interviews; (2) from these factors, a hierarchical risk factor classification structure is created; (3) an analytical hierarchy processing (AHP) method with enhanced consistency to rank risk factor for suppliers is created; and (4) a prototype computer implementation system is developed and tested on an industry example.</abstract>

<abstract>In this study an application of free form deformation for the editing of clouds of points or tessellated surfaces representing industrial parts is presented. The application is based on an efficient implementation of NURBS based free form deformation and the implementation of functions for imposing constraints to position, directions and curvatures of embedded objects. The developed functions permit the direct manipulation of triangulated surfaces eliminating the surface reconstruction stage, reducing the time requested in the reverse engineering process and, at the end, reducing the time to market.</abstract>

<abstract>Production scheduling in mixed batch/continuous plants, due to their hybrid nature, can become very complex. The main contribution of this paper is the presentation of a novel approach based on the integration of the Timed arc hybrid Petri net (TAHPN) and a genetic algorithm (GA) as a suitable tool for scheduling of hybrid systems. The major benefit of this approach is a significant reduction in complexity during problem formulation. The proposed method is explained through a sugar mill case study.</abstract>

<abstract>3D techniques are increasingly used in aerospace industry to improve quality and performance of aircrafts. This paper presents a 3D imaging technique for studying the aerodynamic shape and flight performance of micro air vehicles. 3D stereoscopic vision, based upon stroboscopic imaging, was utilized to obtain the 3D information of the aircraft's flexible aerodynamic surface. The aircraft models with deformable aerodynamic shape were designed and tested in a purpose-built wind tunnel experimental environment. After calculation of SIFT feature points and subdivision of triangular meshes, deformable surface of the aircraft's aerodynamic shape was represented. The aircraft's 3D visualization was used for analyzing unsteady deformation in the aerodynamic shape under external airflow disturbances. The results, together with aerodynamic forces measured in the experiment, will be useful to improve the flight performance and disturbance resistance ability of micro air vehicles.</abstract>

<abstract>This article presents the research work done in order to reduce the gap of heterogeneity between Geographic Information System and Building Information Models. The goal is to extend a platform dedicated to facility management called ACTIVe3D. We want to enlarge its scope to take into account the management of urban elements contained in the building environment, as well as other buildings. The particularity of the platform is that data can be accessed either by a semantic view or through a 3D interface. The SIGA3D project describes a set of processes that aims, for all the stakeholders of urban projects, to manage pieces of information through all the lifecycle of construction projects. To solve the heterogeneity problem between BIM and GIS, we developed a semantic extension to the BIM called UIM (Urban Information Modeling). This extension defines spatial, temporal and multi-representation concepts to build an extensible ontology. The knowledge database can be populated with information coming from standards like IFC and CityGML. This information system has been adapted and implemented into the existing platform and is today fully operational and used by thousands of users.</abstract>

<title>Topological model for machining of parts with complex shapes.</title>
<pages>528-541</pages>

<volume>63</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>Complex shapes are widely used to design products in several industries such as aeronautics, automotive and domestic appliances. Several variations of their curvatures and orientations generate difficulties during their manufacturing or the machining of dies used in moulding, injection and forging. Analysis of several parts highlights two levels of difficulties between three types of shapes: prismatic parts with simple geometrical shapes, aeronautic structure parts composed of several shallow pockets and forging dies composed of several deep cavities which often contain protrusions. This paper mainly concerns High Speed Machining (HSM) of these dies which represent the highest complexity level because of the shapes’ geometry and their topology. Five axes HSM is generally required for such complex shaped parts but 3 axes machining can be sufficient for dies. Evolutions in HSM CAM software and machine tools lead to an important increase in time for machining preparation. Analysis stages of the CAD model particularly induce this time increase which is required for a wise choice of cutting tools and machining strategies. Assistance modules for prismatic parts machining features identification in CAD models are widely implemented in CAM software. In spite of the last CAM evolutions, these kinds of CAM modules are undeveloped for aeronautical structure parts and forging dies. Development of new CAM modules for the extraction of relevant machining areas as well as the definition of the topological relations between these areas must make it possible for the machining assistant to reduce the machining preparation time. In this paper, a model developed for the description of complex shape parts topology is presented. It is based on machining areas extracted for the construction of geometrical features starting from CAD models of the parts. As topology is described in order to assist machining assistant during machining process generation, the difficulties associated with tasks he carried out are analyzed at first. The topological model presented after is based on the basic geometrical features extracted. Topological relations which represent the framework of the model are defined between the basic geometrical features which are gathered afterwards in macro-features. Approach used for the identification of these macro-features is also presented in this paper. Detailed application on the construction of the topological model of forging dies is presented in the last part of the paper.</abstract>

<abstract>Over the last decade, the context of interoperability has been changing rapidly. It has been expanding from the largely technically focused area of Information Systems toward Business Processes and Business Semantics. However, there exists a need for established methods to define Business Interoperability and provide for measuring its performance as a first step toward improving interoperability conditions between collaborating entities. This paper proposes a model that captures the factors that are responsible for Business Interoperability in the context of collaborative business processes. The Business Interoperability Quotient Measurement Model (BIQMM) uses an interdisciplinary approach to embrace the key elements responsible for collaboration performance. Through the quantification of the importance of each element to the particular collaboration scenario, and by combining the BIQMM with the Analytical Network Process (ANP) approach, this model enables a quantitative analysis of Business Interoperability, so that an overall interoperability score can be calculated for enhanced performance measurements. Two application scenarios are presented, validating the proposed model.</abstract>

<abstract>Product-driven control may enable manufacturing companies to meet business demands more quickly and effectively. But a key point in making this concept acceptable by industry is to provide benchmarking environments in order to compare and analyze their efficiency on emulated large-scale industry-led case studies with regard to current technologies and approaches. In this paper, a benchmarking protocol is defined, in order to provide R&D practitioners with benchmarking services in a product-driven implementation project. A component-based generic architecture is proposed to support this protocol, enabling to model and compare various control architectures. This benchmarking protocol is applied to an automotive-industry case study in order to evaluate the impact of making the products interact with the local decision centers. Finally the experiments show that product-driven control can perform as good as traditional centralized control, and that its robustness depends mainly of the local decision-making processes.</abstract>

<abstract>The matching of particular types of CAD models to existing physical models can provide invaluable support to the process of CAD design and reuse. To meet the demand for fast and robust algorithms to detect predefined models in database, an local invariant model matching approach is proposed in this paper. It first maps the 3D CAD model to 2D principal image plane by its first two principal components, and then finds affine invariant key points in the 2D image. The CAD model matching problem is implemented as key points matching. Experimental results show the proposed 3D model retrieval method performs fairly well in retrieving similar models from a database of 3D CAD models.</abstract>

<abstract>This introduction to the special issue discusses the changing role of information technology (IT) in advancing lean production. Lean principles and techniques have been applied in a wide variety of organisations, from make-to-stock to engineer-to-order industries, and even in typical service sectors, such as healthcare. In order to apply lean principles in various areas, variants were developed of well-known techniques, such as Kanban, Kaizen, SMED, and 5S. IT is used to develop such variants. Over the years, the role and use of IT in the application of the lean principles has changed. In this introduction, we discuss the main findings of the papers that were selected for publication in this special issue.</abstract>

<title>A Computational Knowledge Elicitation and Sharing System for mental health case management of the social service industry.</title>

<abstract>Narrative data provide rich information and knowledge to the workers. However, existing systems mainly served as a workflow system, a reporting system, or a database system for storing this kind of information. The massive amount of unstructured narrative data makes it extremely difficult to be shared and reused. Actual knowledge sharing and reuse among the workers is still limited. This paper presents a Computational Knowledge Elicitation and Sharing System which attempts to elicit knowledge from individuals as well as a team and converts it into a structured format and shared among the team. The proposed system accomplishes several current technologies in knowledge-based system, artificial intelligence and natural language processing, which converts the narrative knowledge of knowledge workers into a concept mapping representation. With a sufficient number of narratives, patterns are revealed and an aggregate concept map for all participating members is produced. It converts the unstructured text into a more structured format which helps to summarize and share the knowledge that can be taken in handling different case management issues. Such integration is considered to be novel. A prototype system has been implemented based on the method successfully in the mental healthcare of a social service organization for handling their case management issues. An experiment has been carried out for measuring the accuracy for converting the unstructured data into the structured format. The theoretical results are found to agree well with the experimental results.</abstract>

<abstract>The evolution of computer science and technology has brought new opportunities for multidisciplinary designers and engineers to collaborate with each other in a concurrent and coordinated manner. The development of computational agents with unified data structures and software protocols contributes to the establishment of a new way of working in collaborative design, which is increasingly becoming an international practice. In this paper, based on the analysis of the dynamic nature of collaborative design process, a new framework for collaborative design is described. This framework adopts an agent-based approach and relocates designers, managers, systems, and the supporting agents in a unified knowledge representation scheme for product design. In order to model the constantly evolving design process and the rationales resulted from design collaboration, a Collaborative Product Data Model (CPDM) and a constraint-based Collaborative Design Process Model (CDPM) are proposed to facilitate the management and coordination of the collaborative design process as well as design knowledge management. A prototype system of the proposed framework is implemented and its feasibility is evaluated using a real design scenario whose objective is designing a set of dining table and chairs.</abstract>

<title>An agent-based approach for coordinating product design workflows.</title>

<abstract>New product development processes in manufacturing organizations are distributed and knowledge-intensive. Such product development processes interleave complex manual and software-enabled design decision-making activities. In current approaches to product development, design activities are accomplished by teams of engineers in an ad hoc, resource-intensive manner. Though well-developed tools exist for enabling individual engineering activities, support for autonomous coordination of distributed design tasks is minimal. In this paper, we present an Agent-based Process Coordination (APC) framework for distributed design process management. The proposed approach embeds autonomous agents in a workflow-based distributed systems infrastructure. The framework utilizes a centralized decision-making and task sharing approach to support design activities. A design process plan is executed by a centralized coordination agent with the help of service agents. We evaluate the applicability of the APC framework to support design in an industrial context with a case study. The study illustrates the utility of deploying agent-based workflow technologies to: (a) enable incremental and large-scale process and product knowledge acquisition and management, (b) facilitate design process knowledge reuse in different contexts, and (c) support distributed dynamic process management.</abstract>

<abstract>Agile production planning and control system (APPCS) is a system for planning, scheduling, procurement, and production control. APPCS plays an important role in the competitive environments, such as make-to-order industries, because it excels in immediate uncertainty processing and then guarantees feasibility of the production plan. The uncertainty is often caused by customers who make a change in the order or by suppliers who change their promised items. The customers or suppliers can notify of the change before it really happens. Upon receipt of the change, APPCS responds immediately to achieve higher service level of performance, better resource utilization, and less material loss.</abstract>

<abstract>Increasing global competition has led to massive outsourcing of manufacturing businesses. Such outsourcing practices require effective collaborations between focal manufacturers and their suppliers by sharing a large amount of information. In the meantime, since some of the suppliers are also potential competitors, protection of confidential information, particularly intellectual properties, during the collaboration is becoming an important issue. Therefore, secure collaboration is of critical significance in the global design and supply chain management. This paper aims to collect and analyze systematically the existing scattered research of secure collaboration in global design and supply chain environment, and to give a comprehensive literature review to summarize the problems and the corresponding solutions. By applying the Environment-based Design (EBD) methodology, the existing methods and technologies are classified into four levels: infrastructure, information, agreement, and confidence. Four corresponding research problems are then formulated: information access control, information partitioning, legal information sharing, and partner trust management. As such, research papers scattered in different areas are integrated into this multi-disciplinary field. Future trends and challenges are also discussed in this paper.</abstract>

<abstract>Building construction has become increasingly complicated and extensive. Building information modeling (BIM), which is a technology that allows for the consistent management of information, is regarded as a necessary tool for managing the process of building construction from beginning to end. However, the information provided by BIM is rarely applied to on-site construction planning and scheduling. In this paper, we describe a BIM-based structural framework optimization and simulation system for managing construction planning and scheduling. Moreover we conduct a dynamic visualization of the construction process according to the optimized schedules by applying a predefined calculation formula and logic along with 3D geometry data and process data to determine the amount of work required for major construction processes. In addition, if more than two different construction schedules are fed into the system, it is able to compare construction schedules using its comparison simulation function.</abstract>

<abstract>Internet of Things, by reducing or almost eliminating uncertainty regarding existence, types, conditions and remaining lives of components in an end-of-life product (EOLP), can mitigate planning of remanufacturing operations. Remaining useful life can be taken into account as a good measure of quality. Therefore, immediate determination of remaining useful life allows optimal recovery decisions to guarantee a minimum quality level on recovered products while satisfying various system criteria.</abstract>

<title>Sustainable enterprise interoperability from the Activity Domain Theory perspective.</title>

<volume>63</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>The investigation of sustainable enterprise interoperability requires an explicit position of what constitutes the enterprise. In particular, human aspects like agency, sense-making, interpretation, common understanding, etc., must be taken into account. To this end, the purpose of this contribution is to make an inquiry into interoperability from the perspective of the Activity Domain Theory (ADT). In this theory, the enterprise is considered as a constellation of activity domains. The activity domain is characterized by the activity modalities – objectivation, contextualization, spatialization, temporalization stabilization, transition – which represent human, innate predispositions for coordinating actions. Interoperability is focused to one particular modality: the transition between activity domains. An example from the telecom industry is used to illustrate the approach. Implications for various aspects of interoperability are discussed. In conclusion, it is argued that the ADT is an alternative framework for advancing the understanding of sustainable interoperability between enterprises and enterprise systems.</abstract>

<title>Distributed simulation platform to design advanced RFID based freight transportation systems.</title>

<abstract>RFID systems, known to improve supply chains performances, are little implemented so far in industry, particularly in the field of transport, due to the high economic investment it requests in comparison to other existing solutions. However, their benefits may be theoretically proved by using a distributed simulation platform to support the design and test of any technical solution and organizational approach devoted to optimize RFID-based logistics systems. This paper deals with the development of this simulation platform, based on Generalized Discrete Event Specification (G-DEVS) models and HLA (High Level Architecture) standard. The different partner's components of the networked logistics enterprise are described. The proposed solution is applied to a freight transportation system and emulates the behaviour of the various components (RFID coupled to geolocation and mobile technology) required to optimize the products routing. The behaviour of the main components is G-DEVS formalized including the logistics supplier server, the smart product and the vehicle onboard device to interface the products with a centralized server. Delivery scenarios are then elaborated and simulated to check the behaviour and the intensity of communication network use between distributed G-DEVS models and other simulation components. The strength of the approach lies in the interoperability of the platform to simulate scenarios including discrete event models, real software and hardware devices all linked via an HLA connection. From these results, a discussion is given to validate or reject the conceptual choices about logistics components behaviour and their network bandwidth requirement regarding GSM, GPRS, Bluetooth and RFID networks theoretical capacities.</abstract>

<abstract>To extract desired flaws from various types of images, the integration of different segmentation methods is required. In this study, we present an intelligent method for automatic selection of a proper image segmentation method upon detecting a particular flaw type. The new method is capable of choosing the most suitable method from four segmentation methods currently available. The automatic selection procedures start from the pre-segmentation of an image to be examined. Then, the predetermined features are extracted from the original, foreground, and background images. After that, a suitable segmentation method will be selected using a classifier based on six features. Finally, the image is re-segmented by the selected segmentation method to discover flaws. The proposed method has been tested using 1676 defective images. The results show a significant reduction in misclassification rate from about 44% to 13.96%.</abstract>

<abstract>We show that using example-based photometric stereo, it is possible to achieve realistic reconstructions of the human face. The method can handle non-Lambertian reflectance and attached shadows after a simple calibration step. We use spherical harmonics to model and de-noise the illumination functions from images of a reference object with known shape, and a fast grid technique to invert those functions and recover the surface normal for each point of the target object. The depth coordinate is obtained by weighted multi-scale integration of these normals, using an integration weight mask obtained automatically from the images themselves. We have applied these techniques to improve the PhotoFace system of Hansen et al. (2010).</abstract>

<abstract>Petri nets have been recognised as a high level formal and graphical specification language for modelling, analysis, and control of concurrent asynchronous distributed systems. This paper presents a PN model, synthesised by an extended version of the knitting synthesis technique. This method, as an incremental design approach, establishes the conditions under which the fundamental behavioural properties of the synthesised systems are fulfilled and preserved. That is, the synthesised models are live, bounded, and reversible (cyclic). A Petri net with the aforementioned properties is called a well-behaved Petri net system which is guaranteed to operate in a deadlock-free, stable, and cyclic fashion. Well-behaved Petri net models, synthesised using the proposed method can be compiled into control codes and implemented as real-time controllers for flexible manufacturing systems. The significance of this paper is due to the application of an extended version of knitting synthesis technique to a real life example of a flexible manufacturing system.</abstract>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<abstract>Intelligent products are an undeniable asset for efficient product lifecycle management (PLM), providing ways to capture events related to physical objects at various locations and times. Today and more than ever before, PLM tools and systems must be built upon standards for enhancing interoperability among all product stakeholders and developing tools independent of specific vendors, applications, and operating systems. Based on this observation, this paper develops strategies to improve “information sustainability” in PLM environments using standardized communication interfaces defined by a recent standard proposal named quantum lifecycle management (QLM) messaging standards. More concretely, data synchronization models based upon QLM standards are developed to enable the synchronization of product-related information among various systems, networks, and organizations involved throughout the product lifecycle. Our proposals are implemented and assessed based on two distinct platforms defined in the healthcare and home automation sectors.</abstract>

<abstract>The main purpose of this research is to develop a process for identifying the most suitable shoe last for human feet. A fitness function was defined to determine the most suitable shoe last among several alternatives. Based on reverse engineering (RE) technology, this research included scanning the surface of human feet and shoe lasts in STL (Stereo Lithography) format. An STL slicing algorithm constructed the three most important measurements for human feet and shoe last, i.e., ball girth, waist girth, and instep girth. Fuzzy theory was used to analyze and build the membership functions of these three girths between the shoe last and human feet. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to decide the weighting functions for each girth to determine the fitness function in all shoe last databases for the feet. Three case studies were implemented to find the ranking of 10 shoe lasts in the database. This research, which defined as the relationships between shoe last and human feet, can be used as a good reference for design in the shoe-making process.</abstract>

<title>Using competencies in performance estimation: From the activity to the process.</title>

<volume>58</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>Performance estimation of enterprise processes generally involves models focused on a particular viewpoint (temporal, financial, etc.). This estimation rarely takes the impact of the human factor into account. It is now fully understood that it is important to include this factor when modelling and analyzing enterprise processes. In this paper, a conceptual approach to human resource modelling is proposed on the basis of an analysis of human integration in enterprise process models. The human entity is described through individual and collective competencies, which are needed to implement a process activity and assess its performance. The proposed formally built model provides a new approach to correlating some qualitative and quantitative aspects of the human influence on industrial performance. This model formalizes and generalizes performance estimation by linking human capacities and process performance. This approach is illustrated on an industrial process example.</abstract>

<title>The needs and benefits of Text Mining applications on Post-Project Reviews.</title>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>9</number>
<abstract>Post-Project Reviews (PPRs) are a rich source of knowledge and data for organisations – if organisations have the time and resources to analyse them. Too often these reports are stored, unread by many who could benefit from them. PPR reports attempt to document the project experience – both good and bad. If these reports were analysed collectively, they may expose important detail, e.g. recurring problems or examples of good practice, perhaps repeated across a number of projects. However, because most companies do not have the resources to thoroughly examine PPR reports, either individually or collectively, important insights and opportunities to learn from previous projects, are missed. This research explores the application of knowledge discovery techniques and Text Mining to uncover patterns, associations, and trends from PPR reports. The results might then be used to address problem areas, enhance processes, and improve customer relationships. A case study related to two construction companies is presented in this paper and knowledge discovery techniques are used to analyse 50 PPR reports collected during the last three years. The case study has been examined in six contexts and the results show that Text Mining has a good potential to improve overall knowledge reuse and exploitation.</abstract>

<title>Dynamic workflow change in PDM systems.</title>
<pages>453-463</pages>

<volume>58</volume>

<number>5</number>
<abstract>Current manufacturing industry requires product data management (PDM) for efficient product development and production. As an important part of effective PDM solutions, workflow management facilitates creating and executing workflow so as to streamline business processes. Unfortunately, existing workflow management solutions are designed to handle static business processes; when a workflow change occurs, these solutions usually stop the affected workflow completely and start the modified one from scratch. This over-simplified approach leads to re-execution of nodes whose work have been lost due to the restart process. This paper proposes an approach to facilitate efficient dynamic workflow change by minimising repetitive execution of finished workflow nodes. This approach also address the data integrity issue by managing various workflow data such as node properties and scripts. A case study has been carried out in a PDM system to illustrate the potential application of the approach.</abstract>

<title>An improved approach for automatic process plan generation of complex borings.</title>

<volume>57</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>The research concerns automated generation of process plans using knowledge formalization and capitalization. Tools allowing designers to deal with issues and specifications of the machining domain are taken into account. The main objective of the current work is to prevent designers from designing solutions that would be expensive and difficult to machine. Among all available solutions to achieve this goal, two are distinguished: the generative approach and the analogy approach. The generative approach is more adapted to generate the machining plans of parts composed of numerous boring operations in interaction. However, generative systems have two major problems: proposed solutions are often too numerous and are only geometrically but not technologically relevant. In order to overcome these drawbacks, two new concepts of feature and three control algorithms are developed. The paper presents the two new features: the Machining Enabled Geometrical Feature (MEGF) and the Machinable Features (MbF). This development is the result of the separation of the geometrical and the technological data contained in one machining feature. The second objective of the paper is to improve the current Process Ascending Generation (PAG) system with control algorithms in order to limit the combinatorial explosion and disable the generation of unusable or not machinable solutions.</abstract>

<title>Intelligent feature based process planning for five-axis mill-turn parts.</title>

<volume>60</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>5</number>
<abstract>This paper proposes a new process planning system for five-axis mill-turn parts. This system focuses on parts including both prismatic and rotational features newly defined as Prisronal parts. The three main parts of the new system are as follows: (a) a novel machining features classification based on machining processes and number of simultaneously controlled axes of five-axis lathe; a new group code system is proposed. (b) Machining feature definition with representation; this model not only includes geometric and manufacturing data in the open layer but also includes machining processes and machining knowledge viewed as production rules of expert systems. (c) Process plan generation model; a process plan is generated based on machining features and rules. A user interactively identifies geometric entities to machining features provided as templates by the system. Machining processes and particular machining rules are designed and built-in each machining feature in the hidden layer. Auxiliary rules are provided for setup selection, precedence relation, and tool selection. Benefits of the system are fast and accurate process plan generation.</abstract>

<abstract>The digital factory is becoming ever more prevalent in the planning of production systems. It provides tools that digitally support the planning process. Everything from a single workplace to a complete workshop or even a factory can be represented in the computer, analyzed for potential weaknesses and even revised digitally. In the field of occupational health and safety (OHS), this only affects ergonomic analyses and examinations of single workplaces at present. This micro-ergonomic approach is insufficient for extensive OHS measures because potential risks (e.g. noise) often result from the configuration of the whole work system and workers’ change of workplaces during a shift. Therefore, a macro-ergonomic OHS evaluation approach which considers all elements of a work system and their interactions is also necessary. This paper describes a macro-ergonomic OHS approach to digital work systems planning developed at the ifab-Institute.</abstract>

<abstract>In an environment where supply chains compete against supply chains, information sharing among supply chain partners using information systems is a competitive tool. Supply chain ontology has been proposed as an important medium for attaining information systems interoperability. Ontology has its origin in philosophy, and the computing community has adopted ontology in its language. This paper presents a study of state of the art research in supply chain ontology and identifies the outstanding research gaps. Six supply chain ontology models were identified from a systematic review of literature. A seven point comparison framework was developed to consider the underlying concepts as well as application of the ontology models. The comparison results were then synthesised into nine gaps to inform future supply chain ontology research. This work is a rigorous and systematic attempt to identify and synthesise the research in supply chain ontology.</abstract>

<abstract>The paper focuses on collaborative STEP-based CAD/CAM/CNC supply chains to program and automate machining process data monitoring and traceability activities. A traceability interface (traceability nc_functions) is defined for the new CNC programming standard ISO STEP-NC. CAM systems will be able to program monitoring and data access activities by inserting traceability nc_function calls in CNC programs. On the shop floor, controllers will automatically interpret these nc_functions to access process data while machining and will relate data records with the corresponding machining operations in a STEP-NC part program. With both types of information—process data and standard machining program (STEP-NC part program)—spread and technologically heterogeneous engineering systems will have full knowledge about what has happened in production. Traceability data access automation will assure data reliability. The paper describes a traceability scenario where standards such as MTConnect and ISA-95 support, rather than interfere with, the STEP-NC traceability proposal.</abstract>

<abstract>One of the most important problems when considering the design of manufacturing systems based on SOA paradigms is the integration of shop floor devices in the business processes at the enterprise level. This paper presents the design and implementation of the Customer Order Management (COM) module based on SOA architecture in the context of holonic manufacturing systems. The COM module is integrating with SOA enabled shop floor devices using industry standards. The implementation leverages a multi agent system suited for industrial applications integrated in a SOA environment capable of dynamic BPEL workflow generation and execution. The prototype consists in a SCA application for core COM module functionality and an extension for NetLogo MAS platform for SOA integration. The COM module interacts with the MES layer using real time events handled by the BPEL process implementation in the execution stage. A web based portal frontend for the COM module has been developed to allow real time tracking of customer orders, providing data about product batch execution and individual progress of each product on the production line.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper, a system based on successive image analysis is proposed for periodic measurement of flank wear in milling. The successive images are captured while the spindle is rotating. The blur of the moving images is minimized by the use of a high-speed camera and low spindle speed during the image capture. A method based on image series to measure flank wear has been developed and successfully applied on these moving images. Its performance is compared with the method based on individual still or static images. The results show improved robustness of this system with high potential for industrial application to measure the flank wear in-cycle (between passes) without stopping the spindle.</abstract>

<abstract>Over the past few decades, our industrial age has entered into an important phase in its evolution: innovation. While innovation could proclaim underlying political and strategic intentions when it was still in the early stages, it must now assert itself in the form of tangible and measurable methodological approaches backed by tools that are designed to provide stakeholders with services at every phase of the innovation process. The world of standardization has already perceived the need to standardize and measure innovation. However, it has perhaps not yet anticipated that any form of measurement is only meaningful if our computing tools have been sufficiently developed to cope with this evolution. Indeed, while the age of quality saw the emergence and firm anchoring of several tools in our industrial practice, the age of innovation is still focused on research in the fields of marketing and management, and any initiatives that dare attempt to structure its deployment via radical changes in what is currently known, practised and acknowledged in the business environment today, are thin on the ground. This article traces the historical facts that legitimize the emergence of a new age for tools allowing computer-aided artefact creation and proposes a research agenda for the scientific communities involved.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper discusses the problem to design a generic planning and control architecture for automated material handling systems (AMHSs). We illustrate the relevance of this research direction, and then address three different market sectors where AMHSs are used, i.e., baggage handling, distribution, and parcel & postal. The research in this paper is heavily motivated by a collaboration between the authors and a major global company supplying AMHSs. We analyze requirements from practice for a generic control architecture, and then review the literature to investigate whether these practical requirements have been met. From this confrontation of theory with practice, we conclude that many practical issues are not yet covered in the current literature. We take the initiative to define a research direction in concrete terms, pinpoint problems to work on, and propose an agenda for future research. Moreover, we take a step to propose a concept control architecture.</abstract>

<abstract>Performance measurement systems (PMS) are tools widely used by enterprises for managing and making strategy-based decisions. A PMS defines a group of strategic objectives and associated performance indicators (KPIs) that provide information as to whether the upstream objectives are being reached or not, but with no further information about the causes. Up to now, if an objective is not being reached managers do not have further information regarding the causes; in terms of accurate information they are limited to the associated KPI. However, regarding the decisions to be made: What would they be based on? How and where to dig to find cause-effect relationships? And, even more difficult: How to make it objective? This study presents a unique proposal able to objectively – not based neither on experience nor subjective judgments – identify and quantify relationships between performance elements defined within a PMS, offering additional information to managers to make cross-enterprise decisions. Finally, the paper presents the main results obtained from applying the proposal to a real world enterprise and future research lines.</abstract>

<abstract>With increasing growth of Internet commerce, online fraud accounts for as much as 20% of identity theft cases. The present study evaluated Privacy Bird®, a computer program that warns users of privacy preference violations by displaying a colored bird. Users rated their trust of, and willingness to give financial information to, web sites in three categories (financial, retail, and social networking) before and after using Privacy Bird. Privacy Bird improved participants’ privacy practices, increasing their trust in (and willingness to provide financial information to) web sites that yielded green birds, reducing it for sites that yielded red birds, and inducing further consideration of policies for sites that yielded yellow birds. These results suggest that e-commerce sites should address the privacy concerns of users and make salient the cues that inform users that their privacy is protected.</abstract>

<title>An agent-based collaborative design system to facilitate active die-maker involvement in stamping part design.</title>
<pages>253-271</pages>

<volume>54</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>This paper reports on a collaborative design environment to facilitate active die-maker involvement in metal stamping product development. First, the role of die-maker in the metal stamping development process chain is analyzed comprehensively. The author takes the view that the die-maker should be involved in new product development processes as early as possible to enable concurrent engineering practice in metal stamping development. Then, using the agent-based approach, a multi-agent-based system is constructed to integrate die-maker’s activities into customer product development process within a distributed, collaborative and concurrent environment. The overall architecture incorporates three agent communities: part design agent, die-maker involvement agent, and coordination agent. The content of each agent is described in detail. Each agent community has a facilitator which provides an intermediary between a local collection of sub-agents and remote agents through two main services: routing outgoing messages to the appropriate destinations and translating incoming messages for consumption. Finally, the system implementation is provided. A KQML/XML communication and data exchange method between agents is proposed. A case study is presented to illustrate how the die-maker is involved and cooperates with the part designer to make an optimal part design.</abstract>

<title>Integrating cross-sectional imaging based reverse engineering with rapid prototyping.</title>
<pages>131-140</pages>
<year>2006</year>
<volume>57</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>This paper presents an integrated system of cross-sectional imaging based reverse engineering (RE) and rapid prototyping (RP) for reproducing complex objects. The system consists of four modules: cross-sectional image measurement, 3D reconstruction, stereo lithography (STL) file generation, and RP slice file generation. During cross-sectional image measurement, the object to be measured is encased within resin and then milled, layer-by-layer, using an NC milling machine. After each layer is machined, a CCD camera is used to capture the newly exposed cross-sectional image of the object. The contours of the cross-sectional image are further extracted through image processing and segmentation. A collection of the contour data is acquired by the cross-sectional image measurement module. While a 3D CAD model can be reconstructed by the 3D reconstruction module from the contour data, its STL file and RP slice file are generated directly from the contour data. The algorithm for STL file generation from cross-sectional contours consists of three major steps: (1) preprocessing of cross-section images for data reduction, (2) Delaunay triangulation of contours in the first and last layers and (3) triangulation of contours between adjacent layers. This integrated system and the processing algorithms are further validated through four examples.</abstract>

<title>A new process knowledge representation approach using parameter flow chart.</title>

<number>1</number>
<abstract>Knowledge in various stages of the product development process has become increasingly important for manufacturing companies to improve their performance, especially for those One-of-a-Kind Production (OKP) companies producing highly customized products. Process knowledge is a very special type of knowledge that controls how products are best manufactured. This knowledge can help OKP companies produce high value-added products with better quality at shorter times and at a competitive cost. Process knowledge is normally hard to capture and manage and is even more difficult to represent. This paper proposes a Parameter Flow Chart (PFC) based new knowledge representation method which efficiently combines parameter information, flow chart technology, and visualization technology. The goal of this research is to provide a user-friendly and effective way of representing process knowledge for OKP companies so they can develop and accumulate their own process knowledge repository. The basic definition and principle of the approach will be introduced first and the software system model then proposed. Two related key issues, the modeling of various chart units used in the PFC approach and dealing with expressions containing various parameters, are discussed in detail. The prototype version of the system has been developed and demonstrated with case studies, which has proven the feasibility of the proposed approach.</abstract>

<abstract>This article concerns the integration and deployment of the ERP project at Alcatel, a telecommunications company. After a short presentation of the main activities managed by the ERP system, we propose a five-stage deployment model (selection of the vendor and software, deployment and integration, stabilisation, progression, evolution), then we outline the main results obtained at Alcatel in a general way, and we describe the risks, the dysfunctions, and the reasons for them. The sources and conditions for the successful deployment of ERP are also presented. We focus more precisely on the integration and deployment of the planning process in an ERP system. Therefore, we will detail the different stages of the integration step (general design, detailed design, prototyping and validation, testing and implementing of the solution, operation starting). A detailed model of the planning process is built and used as a tool to help the firm's key users at the different stages of the planning process. In order to improve the control process of the planning system, we develop a control helping system based on performance indicators, and particularly dedicated to control the MRP activity. The goal of this project is to improve the reactivity of the planning system as well as to enhance that of the supply chain.</abstract>

<abstract>Facilitating interaction with maintenance systems through intuitive interfaces is a competitive advantage in terms of time and costs for industry. This work presents the CARMMI approach, which aims to integrate information coming from CAx tools, mixed/augmented reality tools and embedded intelligent maintenance systems. CARMMI aims to provide support to operators/technicians during maintenance tasks through mixed reality, providing an easier access, understanding and comprehension of information from different systems. Information about where, when and which data will be presented in interface are defined by CARMMI. The paper presents three test cases that were performed using the proposed concepts and infrastructure. The main benefit of the approach is to provide an extensive and generic model for the integration and management of maintenance data through the use of CARMMI.</abstract>

<abstract>From human–computer interaction to human–human interaction and from information sharing to instant collaboration are major advances from traditional standalone and distributed CAD to collaborative CAD. This paper explores model, method and tool to achieve this goal. A human-centered collaborative design model to support human–human interaction is presented. A method to transparently add aware capabilities to single-user CAD applications is outlined. Based on the method, an instant collaboration tool is implemented to support human–human interaction in collaborative design process. The collaboration tool involved some core collaborative issues such as agent structure, communication, group awareness, consistency maintenance and collaborative tasks. We also test the method in a 3D collaborative tool for heterogeneous CAD applications.</abstract>

<abstract>Nowadays, a globalization of national markets requires developing the flexible and demand-driven production systems with new innovative concepts of management, information processing, production scheduling and planning. The presented work focuses on the low-level planning, where the multi-agent solution towards a “job-machine” assignment is considered. The main point of the discussion is the flexibility of planning systems ensured by the concept of agent’s “roles” and “emergencies”. Depending on the state of “emergency”, the system receives stepwisely additional degrees of freedom to adapt the planning to the changing conditions of the manufacturing floor. The distributed constraint satisfaction and optimization approaches, underlying the suggested method, as well as activities of rescue agents, are described in the form of Petri networks providing both the conceptual notions and main details of implementation.</abstract>

<abstract>Globalization and rapid evolving of Internet and Web-based technologies have revolutionized the product development process. Engineering a product is a complex process involving the integration of distributed resources, such as human beings, engineering tools, and a large variety of product-related information systems. Software agents have been playing an increasingly important role in this area to reduce the need for large, complex, and centralized systems. This paper presents the results of an industrial case study in the development of a collaborative e-Engineering environment for mechanical product design engineering by applying intelligent software agents, Internet/Web, workflow, and database technologies. A software prototype system has been implemented on a FIPA-compliant agent platform, with a wheel–axle assembly being used as a test case for system validation.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper key components in an intelligent product are defined and an associated intelligent product model is formulated. In this model, each product is equipped with an Intelligent Data Unit that connects to a regional back-end service enabler over the Communication Support Infrastructure (e.g. Internet) for lifecycle data transmission. An Intelligent Data Unit is a hardware device that consists of sensors, a controller, memory and data communication interface, which can be embedded into the product to acquire the lifecycle data. A service enabler is a software agent that receives the lifecycle data, and uses it to enable services and provide useful information and knowledge. The analysis and design of a service enabler is described, and a prototype service enabler is developed. It has been demonstrated in field trials that intelligent products built in this way can enable suitable product-related services.</abstract>

<abstract>In order to utilize the potential advantages of replicated collaborative CAD system to support natural, free, fast and less-constrained multi-user human-to-human interaction, a local-locking mechanism, which can provide fast modeling response, is adopted as concurrency control mechanism for a replicated on-line collaborative CAD system. A human–human interactive modeling is achieved by immediate local execution of modeling operations and exchange of modeling operations across all collaborative sites real-time. In particular, an approach to achieve topological entity correspondence across collaborative sites during modeling procedure, which is critical to guarantee the correctness and consistency of collaborative modeling result, is proposed. A prototype system based on the ACIS geometric modeling kernel is implemented to verify availability of the proposed solution.</abstract>

<abstract>Three-dimensional (3D) image processing provides a useful tool for machine vision applications. Typically a 3D vision system is divided into data acquisition, low-level processing, object representation and matching. In this paper, a 3D object pose estimation method is developed for an automated manufacturing assembly process. The experimental results show that the 3D pose estimation method produces accurate geometrical information for an automated material handling application.</abstract>

<abstract>The mobile phone has become an indispensable device in everyday life. However, many usability problems were generated by the multi-functionality of mobile phones. There was an important increase on the user interface (UI) design and usability. With the introduction of a variety of forms and keypads in mobile phones, the user's need of controllability, grip-stability, and usability were raised in the UI aspect. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the physical user interface (PUI) elements of mobile phones, and defined the degree of usability risk such as key level value, function level value, and grip level value. Also, this study proposed an evaluation framework to quantitatively measure the usability risk in the mobile phone PUI elements. For this, the mobile phone PUI elements were analyzed and classified by key type, function, and form-factor. Hence, in the case study was investigated and evaluated 133 mobile phones in the market by the proposed framework. As a result, the proposed evaluation framework enabled the measurement of the mobile phone usability risk level in the early stages of the concept design. This made possible the prediction of design problems related with the mobile phone PUI.</abstract>

<abstract>Manufacturers in the 21st century will face increased customization, product proliferation, shorter product lifecycle and development time, responsiveness, frequent and unpredictable market changes. To gain the competitive advantage, manufacturing companies must be able to analyze and predict product quality during the product design phase and identify root causes of all faults for productivity improvement during ramp-up time and production time. Therefore, a new manufacturing strategy, namely, stream of variation (SoV) methodology, has been proposed, developed and applied. The SoV methodology is a generic math model for modeling, analysis, prediction and control of product quality and productivity improvement in complex multistage manufacturing systems such as automotive, aerospace, appliance, and electronics industries. The methodology integrates multivariate statistics, control theory and design/manufacturing knowledge into a unified framework and can help in eliminating costly trial-and-error fine-tuning of new-product manufacturing processes throughout the product design and manufacturing. The related issues of the state-of-the-art practice, goals, benefits and future directions related to SoV methodology are discussed, which include rationale of SoV, state space model, root causes identification, etc. An application example is also provided.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents a multi-agent negotiation mechanism for distributed design based on price schedules decomposition. The mechanism allows self-interested collaborators to jointly make design decisions for the benefit of an overall design task without disclosing individual objectives or rationales. This work extended a price schedules decomposition algorithm originally developed as a bi-level approach into a hierarchical decomposition algorithm by introducing augmented price schedules. Integrated with multi-agent technologies, the negotiation protocol, and strategy derived from the hierarchical algorithm realize a secure environment for automating distributed engineering design. A test scenario of distributed reliability allocation in complex system development validates the proposed mechanism.</abstract>

<title>Identification of abnormal events by data monitoring: Application to complex systems.</title>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<abstract>Many maintenance actions, such as mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic skills, are mandatory to maintain complex systems in operational conditions. Considerable research has been conducted in these fields to optimize maintenance actions. Most research proposes approaches based on physics: physical model of a specific failure, law of aging, etc. In spite of their performance, these approaches are quite difficult to implement on a complex integrated system. Each field of expertise assesses the good health of a system part using its own experts, its own methods, and, in some cases, its own data. Nevertheless, these fields all make up the same machine, and no interaction between systems is considered. Our study is not based on physical approaches but uses operational data and mathematical tools to diagnose, off-line, the current state of the system. The proposed paper concerns a new concept consisting in characterizing normal system functioning by using data recorded during monitoring. The life profile of this complex system is described by employing all the available data to determine, on the one hand, all normal events and, on the other, to identify abnormal events according to their position compared to the normal envelope defined. The recorded data are then specifically analyzed to characterize the level of criticism of an event considered to be abnormal. This abnormal event could then be assimilated to a global behavioral drift of the studied behavior, which is different to usual behavior. This approach is applied to helicopters by use of all flight recorded data.</abstract>

<abstract>Maturity is defined as a measure to evaluate the capabilities of an organization in regards to a certain discipline. The Collaborative Planning Process is a very complex process and Coordination mechanisms are especially relevant in this field to align the plans of the supply chain members. The objective of this paper is to develop a maturity model and a methodology to perform assessment for the Structural Elements of Coordination Mechanisms in the Collaborative Planning Process. Structural elements are specified in order to characterize coordination mechanisms in a collaborative planning context and they have been defined as key areas to be assessed by the maturity model. The identified structural elements are: number of decision-makers, collaboration level, interdependence relationships nature, interdependence relationships type, number of coordination mechanisms, information exchanged, information processing, decision sequence characteristics and stopping criteria. Structural elements are assessed using the scheme of five levels: Initial, Repeatable, Defined, Managed and Optimized. This proposal has been applied to a ceramic tile company and the results are also reported.</abstract>

<title>A hybrid hint-based and graph-based framework for recognition of interacting milling features.</title>

<abstract>Among the existing feature recognition approaches, graph-based and hint-based approaches are more popular. While graph-based algorithms are quite successful in recognizing isolated features, hint based approaches intrinsically show better performance in handling interacting features. In this paper, feature traces as defined by hint based approaches are implemented and represented in concave graph forms helping the recognition of interacting features with less computational effort. The concave graphs are also used to handle curved 2.5D features while many of the previous graph-based approaches have merely dealt with polyhedral features. The method begins by decomposing the part graph to generate a set of concave sub-graphs. A feature is then recognized based on the properties of the whole concave graph or the properties of its nodes. Graph-based approaches are not intrinsically suitable to provide volumetric representation for the features, but the complete boundary information of a feature can be more effectively obtained volumetrically. Therefore, in this research a method to generate feature volumes for the recognized sub-graphs is also proposed. The approach shows better recognition ability than sub-graph isomorphism methods.</abstract>

<title>A Ranking Chaos Algorithm for dual scheduling of cloud service and computing resource in private cloud.</title>

<abstract>Private cloud as an important branch of cloud computing has brought significant benefit to many kinds of conglomerates in resource sharing. With central management of centre console, Service Composition Optimal Selection (SCOS) and Optimal Allocation of Computing Resources (OACR) are two critical steps for implementing high flexible and agile service provision and resource sharing among sub-enterprises and partner-enterprises under the key technologies of virtualization. However, two steps decision-making are inefficient and cumbersome. To overcome this deficiency, the idea of combining SCOS and OACR into one-time decision in one console is first presented in this paper, named Dual Scheduling of Cloud Services and Computing Resources (DS-CSCR). The mutual relations between the upper layer cloud services and the underlying infrastructures and their properties in the private cloud of conglomerate are deeply analyzed. For addressing large-scale DS-CSCR problem, a new Ranking Chaos Optimization (RCO) is proposed. With the consideration of large-scale irregular solution spaces, new adaptive chaos operator is designed to traverse wider spaces within a short time. Besides, dynamic heuristic and ranking selection are introduced to control the chaos evolution in the proposed algorithm. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the new DS-CSCR outperforms the traditional two-level decision making with the improvements in both cloud service composition and computing resource allocation. In addition, RCO can remarkably give much prominent solutions with low time-consuming and high stability than a few typical intelligent algorithms for solving DS-CSCR in private cloud. With the new DS-CSCR and RCO, cloud services and computing infrastructures can then be quickly combined and shared with high efficient decision.</abstract>

<abstract>In order to develop a well-balanced product, it is necessary to consider not only the customers, but also all the other stakeholders throughout the product's life cycle. A holistic view is needed in order to manage all criteria, considering as many perspectives and interests as possible. This paper presents a model that provides a common understanding for stakeholders involved, together with the requirements, functions and sub-systems of the product being developed. The model supports the decision making process, and supports the designer to balance the interests of different stakeholders and the related functions. This results in a product developed according to all known demands from various stakeholders. This, in turn, will enhance the possibility of success in the market. The model has been applied in an industrial case study.</abstract>

<abstract>The aim of this study is to show how a timed Petri nets framework can be used to model and analyze a supply chain (SC) network which is subject to various risks. The method is illustrated by an industrial case study. We first investigate the disruption factors of the SC network by a failure mode, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) technique. We then integrate the risk management procedures into design, planning, and performance evaluation process of supply chain networks through Petri net (PN) based simulation. The developed PN model provides an efficient environment for defining uncertainties in the system and evaluating the added value of the risk mitigation actions. The findings of the case study shows that the system performance can be improved using risk management actions and the overall system costs can be reduced by mitigation scenarios.</abstract>

<abstract>Reliable feature extraction, condition monitoring, and fault modeling are critical to understanding equipment degradation and implementing the proper maintenance decisions in manufacturing processes. Semiconductor manufacturing machines are highly sophisticated systems, consisting of multiple interacting components operating in highly variable operating conditions. This complicates performance monitoring since equipment condition must often be inferred through concurrent interpretation of multiple sensor readings originating from potentially very different subsystems of the tool. This paper presents an integrated approach to feature extraction, condition monitoring, and fault modeling applied to a set of standard built-in sensors on a modern 300-mm technology industrial Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) tool. Linear Discriminant Analysis was utilized to determine the set of dynamic features that are the most sensitive to different tool conditions brought about by chamber cleaning or various faults. Gaussian Mixture Models of the dynamic feature distributions were used to statistically quantify changes of these features as the condition of the tool changed. In addition, four highly detrimental faults were analyzed to demonstrate the fault modeling methodology. Data collected over 8 months from a PECVD tool being operated by a major microelectronics manufacturer was used to verify the methodology. Top sensitive features from various faults observed in this period were examined and physical connections to the chamber condition were interpreted through their behavior.</abstract>

<abstract>Nowadays, business supply chains for the production of complex products or services are likely to involve a number of autonomous organizations. The competitive market requires that these supply chains are highly agile, effective and efficient. Agility and effectiveness are obtained by forming highly dynamic virtual enterprises within supplier networks. We call these instant virtual enterprises (IVEs). The required efficiency of creating and operating IVEs can only be obtained by automated support for design, setup and enactment of business processes within these IVEs. This process support involves the dynamic composition of local processes of network members into global processes at the IVE level. This functionality goes significantly beyond traditional approaches for interorganizational workflow management. The approach, architecture and technology required for this dynamic network process management in IVEs are outlined in this paper. We show how the developed approach is applied in the automotive industry in the context of the CrossWork IST project.</abstract>

<abstract>Many manufacturers are facing a complex situation in the mixed production environment, in which green and non-green products are fabricated simultaneously. They are losing competitiveness as a downstream supplier due to lacking of a cost-effective approach to managing product variations compliant with different green directives. This paper presents a methodology based on generic modularized product architecture that facilitates data management of green product development. The four-level architecture allows one unified representation for multiple product models. An option control mechanism enables a quick generation of their BOMs (bills of material). A procedure consisting of seven steps is proposed to accomplish this. PDM functions are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology using a real LCD TV family as an example. This work complements the past studies on green product development, which mainly tackled the problem from design, process, and supply chain improvement. In contrast, from a management perspective, the proposed methodology provides a simple but useful tool for small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to perform green product development in an economical manner.</abstract>

<abstract>Manufacturing enterprises around the world have made significant efforts to provide high value added services in addition to their traditional product development and manufacturing business. A product service system (PSS) is presented in this paper which aims to better integrate product development with maintenance and service operations. This project focuses on the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services in the aerospace industry. A MRO service model is proposed for the development of the proposed PSS. An ontology-based knowledge representation model is developed for the reuse of knowledge unambiguously in MRO services. An initial attempt has been made to demonstrate the role of PSS in the aerospace industry as a decision support tool for MRO services. Product lifecycle management (PLM) environment and Web-based technologies have been developed to enable the methodology to provide services and support in the aerospace manufacturing and flight operations business.</abstract>

<abstract>As more and more organizations move from functional to process-based IT infrastructure, ERP systems are becoming one of today's most widespread IT solutions. However, not all firms have been successful in their ERP implementations. Using a case study methodology grounded in business process change theory, this research tries to understand the factors that lead to the success or failure of ERP projects. The results from our comparative case study of 4 firms that implemented an ERP system suggest that a cautious, evolutionary, bureaucratic implementation process backed with careful change management, network relationships, and cultural readiness have a positive impact on several ERP implementations. Understanding such effects will enable managers to be more proactive and better prepared for ERP implementation. Managerial implications of the findings and future research directions are discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents a neural network-based vision inspection system interfaced with a robot to detect and report IC lead defects on-line. The vision system consists of custom software that contains a neural network database for each of the ICs to be inspected on a PCB. The vision system uses gray scale images and a single layer neural network with three outputs based on defect criteria. Each IC has a different inspection area, thus, the input vector varies for each of the ICs. The IC networks were trained with Matlab's Bayesian regularization module. Performance of each of the networks investigated was found to be 100% based on the defect criteria. This system has been implemented and tested on several electronic products using ProE, C++ and OpenGL software platforms [R. Balderas, S.

<abstract>The use of 3D imaging techniques has been early adopted in the footwear industry. In particular, 3D imaging could be used to aid commerce and improve the quality and sales of shoes. Footwear customization is an added value aimed not only to improve product quality, but also consumer comfort. Moreover, customisation implies a new business model that avoids the competition of mass production coming from new manufacturers settled mainly in Asian countries.</abstract>

<abstract>Robot calibration is a widely studied area for which a variety of solutions have been generated. Most of the methods proposed address the calibration problem by establishing a model structure followed by indirect, often ill-conditioned numeric parameter identification. This paper introduces a new inverse static kinematic calibration technique based on genetic programming, which is used to establish and identify model structure and parameters. The technique has the potential to identify the true calibration model avoiding the problems of conventional methods. The fundamentals of this approach are described and experimental results provided.</abstract>

<title>Tangible authoring of 3D virtual scenes in dynamic augmented reality environment.</title>

<abstract>This paper proposes tangible interfaces and interactions for authoring 3D virtual and immersive scenes easily and intuitively in tangible augmented reality (AR) environment. It provides tangible interfaces for manipulating virtual objects in a natural and intuitive manner and supports adaptive and accurate vision-based tracking in AR environments. In particular, RFID is used to directly integrate physical objects with virtual objects and to systematically support the tangible query of the relation between physical objects and virtual ones, which can provide more intuitive tangibility and a new way of virtual object manipulation. Moreover, the proposed approach offers an easy and intuitive switching mechanism between tangible environment and virtual environment. This paper also proposes a context-adaptive marker tracking method which can remove an inconsistent problem while embedding virtual objects into physical ones in tangible AR environments. The context-adaptive tracking method not only adjusts the locations of invisible markers by interpolating the locations of existing reference markers and those of previous ones, but also removes a jumping effect of movable virtual objects when their references are changed from one marker to another. Several case studies for generating tangible virtual scenes and comparison with previous work are given to show the effectiveness and novelty of the proposed approach.</abstract>

<title>Construction of a computer-simulated mixed reality environment for virtual factory layout planning.</title>

<abstract>To survive the cut-throat competition in the manufacturing industry, many companies have introduced digital manufacturing technology. Digital manufacturing technology not only shortens the product development cycle times but also improves the precision of engineering simulation. However, building the virtual objects needed for a digital manufacturing environment requires skilled human resources; it is also costly and time-consuming. A high precision environment with the similar resources is also needed for a high precision simulation. In this paper, we propose a method of constructing a mixed reality-based digital manufacturing environment. The method integrates real objects, such as real images, with the virtual objects of a virtual manufacturing system. This type of integration minimizes the cost of implementing virtual objects and enhances the user's sense of reality. We studied several methods and derived a general framework for the system. Finally, we developed our idea into a virtual factory layout planning system. To assign the pose and position of real objects in virtual space, we applied a circle-based tracking method which uses a safety sign instead of the planar-square-shaped marker generally used for registration. Furthermore, we developed the framework to encapsulate simulation data from legacy data and process data for visualization based on mixed reality.</abstract>

<title>Development of an engine crankshaft in a framework of computer-aided innovation.</title>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>8</number>
<abstract>This paper describes the conceptual framework of a general strategy for developing an engine crankshaft based on computer-aided innovation, together with an introduction to the methodologies from which our strategy evolves. It begins with a description of two already popular disciplines, which have their roots in computer science and natural evolution: evolutionary design (ED) and genetic algorithms (GAs). A description of some optimization processes in the field of mechanical design is also presented. We explain our approach to multi-objective optimization and show how tools like the Pareto diagram can help in identifying conflicts. The concepts presented here are exemplified through the optimization of a combustion engine crankshaft. The main premise of the paper is the possibility to optimize the imbalance of a crankshaft using tools developed in this methodology. This study brings together techniques that have their origins in the fields of optimization and new tools for innovation. We reflect on how computers can have an active role in the conceptual design process, and explain how TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) can enrich the discipline of ED. The aim of our research is to extend the search for solutions with GAs and present creative, innovative alternatives to the designer. Similarities between GAs and TRIZ regarding ideality and evolution are presented. We also explain how geometric optimization systems (size, shape, topology and topography) offer hints about the next generation of optimization tools. The role of splines in this context is found to be closely integrated with GAs in enabling this development on a computer-aided design and engineering (CAD&CAE) software interface, and in enabling integration with Java programming language for automation of the development.</abstract>

<abstract>Distributed software development has resulted in formation of business partners spread across different economic, temporal, and organizational zones collaborating together for shared authorship of evolving software artifacts. However, the distributed approach is not without risks, and organizations implement specific test strategies to assist in the verification process of work-in-progress software artifacts. This paper discusses the test strategies adopted in the software development lifecycle by a service provider pursuing distributed software development in New Zealand, Australia, and India. Verification and validation processes have been deployed to ascertain the quality, security and traceability of artifacts developed in distributed sites. Findings reveal that strategies are based on protection of sensitive data through management of test database, use of drivers and interfacing stub supports between modules, as well as compliance verification on incremental releases through a customized “Synchronize and Stabilize” lifecycle model. A staging environment, within the case business context, is used for evaluating the robustness of the software product before its official launch in production environment. The actual ongoing work practices within distributed software business environments are presented, which provide value to academia, industry, ICT sector and government institutions.</abstract>

<abstract>The growing complexity of modern organisations poses a series of challenges, among them the cooperation between autonomous and heterogeneous information systems in distributed networks. Actually, information systems (IS) are said to be cooperative if they share common goals in their environment and jointly contribute to achieve these common goals. Obviously, this presupposes the ability to exchange information and then to use it in accordance with each information system required. In the literature, these features refer to interoperability. In this context, one of the main issues concerns the evaluation of the lack of interoperability between Cooperative Information Systems (CIS) through the measurement of their semantic gaps. In order to achieve this purpose, this paper proposes a mathematical formalisation of the semantic relationships between CIS conceptual models. The resulting formal model is then analysed for evaluating the lack of interoperability implications to the global information systems shared goals. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study dealing with a B2M (Business to Manufacturing) interoperability requirement between an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) application.</abstract>

<abstract>Nowadays companies operate in a difficult environment: the dynamics of innovations increase and product life cycles become shorter. Furthermore products and the corresponding manufacturing processes get more and more complex. Therefore, companies need new methods for the planning of manufacturing systems. One promising approach in this context is digital factory/virtual production—the modeling and analysis of computer models of the planned factory with the objective to reduce time and costs. For the modeling and analysis various simulation methods and programs have been developed. They are a highly valuable support for planning and visualizing the manufacturing system. But there is one major disadvantage: only experienced and long trained experts are able to operate with these programs. The graphical user interface is very complex and not intuitive to use. This results in an extensive and error-prone modeling of complex simulation models and a time-consuming interpretation of the simulation results.</abstract>

<title>Knowledge sharing in virtual enterprises via an ontology-based access control approach.</title>

<abstract>Collaborating throughout a product life cycle via virtual enterprise (VE) is one of the most promising strategies for enhancing global competitiveness. Efficient and secure knowledge sharing is critical to the success of a VE. This study presents a novel approach, model and technology for knowledge access control and sharing across enterprises. First, this study proposes an ontology-based knowledge sharing model and a multiple-layer knowledge representation framework on which a knowledge access control model for knowledge sharing in a VE is proposed. In the proposed model, user authorizations permitting access to knowledge in a VE are classified into two levels: (1) basic privileges and (2) extended privileges. The former is evaluated from four dimensions, i.e. who, what, when and where, while the latter is determined by considering how three domain ontologies, i.e., product, organization and activity, are related. This study then develops a knowledge access control policy (KACP) language model which is used to identify the knowledge access control and sharing rules of a VE and all its enterprise members. The knowledge access control model proposed in this study can facilitate VE Knowledge management and sharing across enterprises, enhance knowledge sharing security and flexibility and regulate knowledge sharing to expeditiously reflect changes in the business environment.</abstract>

<abstract>Both the Product-Service System (PSS) literature and industry express a need to close the design loop by using product-in-use data to inform PSS Conceptual Design. Nevertheless, how to actually accomplish this is largely unknown. This research makes use of the literature as well as findings from interviews and case studies with industry as the basis for a framework which could utilise system-in-use (rather than just product-in-use) data from in-service records and receiver needs regarding the use of large, capital-intensive, technical assets to generate solutions which could aid the conception of PSS at the Conceptual Design stage.</abstract>

<title>Enterprise Resource Planning systems: An assessment of applicability to Make-To-Order companies.</title>
<pages>692-705</pages>

<number>7</number>
<abstract>Many vendors of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems claim their products are widely applicable–configurable to meet the needs of any business, whatever the product or service offering. But Make-To-Order (MTO) companies, which produce high-variety and bespoke products, have particularly challenging decision support requirements and it remains unclear whether ERP systems can meet their needs. This paper takes a contingency-based perspective of ERP adoption, assessing the fit or alignment between ERP functionality and a MTO production strategy. MTO features considered include: decision support requirements at critical Production Planning and Control (PPC) stages, idiosyncratic market-related features, typical company size and supply chain positioning, and shop floor configuration. It finds a substantial gap or misalignment between ERP functionality and MTO requirements; for example, between decision support provided by ERP systems and the decision support required by MTO companies at the customer enquiry and design & engineering stages. A research agenda for improving alignment is outlined, with implications for academics, MTO managers and ERP software developers. This includes: developing decision support tools that reflect the customer enquiry management activities of MTO companies; embedding MTO-relevant PPC concepts within ERP systems; and, conducting an in-depth empirical study into applications of ERP systems in MTO companies, assessing their performance impact.</abstract>

<abstract>Cross-organizational collaborations require the management of models for: collaborative business processes (CBPs), which define the collaboration's behavior; and integration business processes (IBPs), which define the behavior that supports the role an organization performs in a CBP. Managing these business process models becomes a complex task when organizations integrate collaborative networks and set up several cross-organizational collaborations. This paper presents a distributed repository that provides the functionalities required to manage conceptual business process models involved in cross-organizational collaborations. A service-oriented architecture is proposed for the distributed repository. This architecture enables organizations to access a global repository for managing collaborative networks, cross-organizational collaborations, and their CBP models. Organizations can also maintain local repositories of IBP models, which are synchronized and consistent with CBP models, while preserving their private aspects. By using verification methods and a model-driven architecture method, the distributed repository provides services that support the synchronization, consistency and interoperability requirements for CBP and IBP models. A case study is presented along with an implementation of the distributed repository.</abstract>

<volume>56</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>This study presents a novel approach for establishing an intelligent support system in order to design a product family through managing variety. Two approaches are applied successively. First, the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) approach identifies the exterior drivers of design variation. Second, the Interpretive Structural Model (ISM) technique is applied to visualize the hierarchy of component interactions within a product. This approach represents the design priority and related design constraints within a product using a structural graph, helping designers to create variant design solutions in a product family for different market requests. The methodology proposed here is illustrated via the example of the design of a family of automatic drip coffee makers.</abstract>

<abstract>This article examines current developments in the field of CAI. The field of CAI has been driven by two major recent developments. One being the technological possibilities in the software field commonly referred to as “Web 2.0”. The other being a strategic paradigm shift from closed to open innovation in many companies. Both developments lead to a new form of CAI which have been analyzed in detail and named Open CAI 2.0. This paper discusses the benefits and challenges for software providers and users arising from this new evolutionary step of CAI.</abstract>

<abstract>Deformation of the workpiece may cause dimensional problems in machining. Supports and locators are used in order to reduce the error caused by elastic deformation of the workpiece. The optimization of support, locator and clamp locations is a critical problem to minimize the geometric error in workpiece machining. In this paper, the application of genetic algorithms (GAs) to the fixture layout optimization is presented to handle fixture layout optimization problem. A genetic algorithm based approach is developed to optimise fixture layout through integrating a finite element code running in batch mode to compute the objective function values for each generation. Case studies are given to illustrate the application of proposed approach. Chromosome library approach is used to decrease the total solution time. Developed GA keeps track of previosly analyzed designs, therefore the number of function evaulations are decreased about 93%. The results of this approach show that the fixture layout optimization problems are multi-modal problems. Optimized designs do not have any apparent similarities although they provide very similar performances.</abstract>

<title>Managing the full ERP life-cycle: Considerations of maintenance and support requirements and IT governance practice as integral elements of the formula for successful ERP adoption.</title>

<volume>61</volume>

<abstract>Companies adopting enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have often focused primarily on implementation-related factors while neglecting those of post-implementation. As a result, the usefulness and operation of the ERP systems, once installed, are compromised. This research adopted a case study approach to demonstrate that ERP adoption efforts that fail to pay attention to post-implementation requirements (especially those relevant to maintenance and support (M&S)) from an early stage in the project lifecycle will face dire consequences. It points out that poor planning and management of M&S services can imperil the normal operations of an ERP system and the daily activities of a business. With the life span of ERP systems getting shorter, sound M&S practices can extend their life and create a stable system platform to support efficient and effective business operations. M&S issues deserve to be considered as integral elements among the critical success factors (CSF) of ERP adoption projects. In other words, ERP success requires a full lifecycle perspective to be taken by adopting companies. With lessons having been learned from the mistakes in the first project, the company in this case study revamped its ERP implementation second time out, with due consideration being given to M&S strategies and practices from project initiation onward in order to realize a stable, usable, and maintainable system. The case study explores and identifies the critical success factors (CSF) of ERP adoption, and shows that M&S must be included as a key element from the outset and throughout the system lifecycle. Our findings capture a great deal of experience for any ERP adopting companies to follow in order to avoid learning costly lessons both in implementation and subsequent M&S throughout the lifespan of the system. A set of propositions is also presented for academic researcher to consider in future ERP research endeavors.</abstract>

<title>A fuzzy strategic alliance selection framework for supply chain partnering under limited evaluation resources.</title>

<abstract>Joining a global supply chain (SC) is a critical strategy to stay competitive for today’s business. However, numerous decision attributes, either subjective or objective, need to be considered; and these evaluation processes are always complicated and costly. This paper presents a fuzzy decision-making framework for selecting the most favourable strategic SC alliance under limited evaluation resources. Firstly, a generic configuration hierarchy (GCH) is identified which comprises 183 evaluation attributes for general industrial SC partnering consideration. Secondly, to target the specific industry of interest, a customized configuration hierarchy (CCH) is extracted from GCH with basic belief acceptability values for all attributes assigned by experts. Thirdly, adding the evaluation resource constraints to CCH, a 0–1 non-linear programming model is formulated to determine the optimal configuration hierarchy. Fourthly, a fuzzy-rule based relationship intensity function jointly with a fuzzy relationship hierarchy is then constructed to derive and rank the final fuzzy favorabilities for all candidate SCs. Lastly, an illustrative example for a personal computer company that intends to partner with one of three SCs is developed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework.</abstract>

<abstract>World Health Organization estimates that 80% of the world population is affected by back-related disorders during his life. Current practices to analyze musculo-skeletal disorders (MSDs) are expensive, subjective, and invasive. In this work, we propose a tool for static body posture analysis and dynamic range of movement estimation of the skeleton joints based on 3D anthropometric information from multi-modal data. Given a set of keypoints, RGB and depth data are aligned, depth surface is reconstructed, keypoints are matched, and accurate measurements about posture and spinal curvature are computed. Given a set of joints, range of movement measurements is also obtained. Moreover, gesture recognition based on joint movements is performed to look for the correctness in the development of physical exercises. The system shows high precision and reliable measurements, being useful for posture reeducation purposes to prevent MSDs, as well as tracking the posture evolution of patients in rehabilitation treatments.</abstract>

<abstract>Even if the research domain related to interoperability has been developed for more than 10 years and particularly for the last 8 years, the different kinds of interoperability and the different problems to solve need to be consolidated in order to define a real science. Moreover, because of the continuous evolution of enterprises in supply chains, interoperability problems must continuously be considered and solved in order to reach a sustainable interoperability.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper proposes new research themes concerning decision support in intermodal transport. Decision support models have been constructed for private stakeholders (e.g. network operators, drayage operators, terminal operators or intermodal operators) as well as for public actors such as policy makers and port authorities. Intermodal research topics include policy support, terminal network design, intermodal service network design, intermodal routing, drayage operations and ICT innovations. For each research topic, the current state of the art and gaps in existing models are identified. Current trends in intermodal decision support models include the introduction of environmental concerns, the development of dynamic models and the growth in innovative applications of Operations Research techniques. Limited data availability and problem size (network scale) and related computational considerations are issues which increase the complexity of decision support in intermodal transport.</abstract>

<title>The concurrent application of lean production and ERP: Towards an ERP-based lean implementation process.</title>

<abstract>Lean production and enterprise resource planning systems are often quoted as being the two most important strategies for achieving competitive advantage in today's global manufacturing environments. Though IT has traditionally been viewed as a contributor to waste within lean production, we suggest that modern developments in IT and the onset of hybrid “push-pull” production control mechanisms have allowed ERP and lean approaches to converge towards a state where ERP systems can in fact be used to support the deployment of lean practices. This paper analyses typical lean and ERP implementation processes contained within the scientific literature, and by further examining a concurrent implementation process in real-time, we develop and propose a process for ERP-based lean implementations. Our findings suggest that the implementation of a contemporary ERP system can act as a catalyst for the application of lean production practices.</abstract>

<title>Supporting product design by anticipating the success chances of new value profiles.</title>

<abstract>Companies willing to introduce radical innovations have to face the tough task of correctly evaluating manifold aspects concerning the lifecycle of the new products to be launched. In such a circumstance severe difficulties arise because, at the very beginning of the design process, project teams own limited and unreliable information about the performances viable to positively impact value for customers and consequently the commercial success. The present paper suggests an original approach for the anticipatory assessment of the expected market appraisal of a new product profile. The proposed “Value Assessment Metrics” (VAMs) is a tool to estimate the success potential of a new artefact through a balance of its functionalities and features with respect to the alternatives existing in the market. The metrics are defined through an induction process from a large collection of successful innovations and market failures. After reporting the methodological approaches adopted to build the VAMs, the first based on Logistic Regression, the second on Neural Networks, the paper presents their preliminary validation and two example applications to the proposition of an innovative lipstick and a concealed hinge.</abstract>

<title>Agents-based design for fault management systems in industrial processes.</title>
<pages>313-328</pages>

<volume>58</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>4</number>
<abstract>Industrial necessities claim global management procedures integrating information systems in order to manage and to use the whole information about controlled processes and thus, to assure a good process behaviour. Fault management and maintenance are vital aspects in industrial management, in this sense, maintenance systems should support decision-making tools, new maintenance approaches and techniques, the enterprise thinking and flexibility. In this work, a reference model for fault management in industrial processes is proposed. This model is based on a generic framework using multi-agent systems for distributed control systems; in this sense, the fault management problem is viewed like a feedback control process and the actions are related to the decision-making in the scheduling of the preventive maintenance task and the running of preventive and corrective specific maintenance tasks. A particular methodology permitting the conception and analysis of the agent systems is used for the agents design. As a result, a set of models describing the general characteristics of the agents, specific tasks, communications and coordination is obtained.</abstract>

<abstract>Enterprise Interoperability is a high-impact productivity factor both within the private and the public sector, affecting the overall quality, yield time and cost of transactions, as well as the design of manufacturing operations or digital public services. This paper addresses the rationale and analysis of the results of the special issue on sustainable interoperability, which is defined here as focusing on novel strategies, methods and tools to maintain and sustain the interoperability of enterprise systems in networked environments as they evolve with their environments. The paper starts by reviewing current state of the systems interoperability research domain and describing the constitution of the community of systems interoperability research and application. We then outline this community's progress on the development of a science base for Enterprise Interoperability. The paper then identifies how each paper in this special issue contributes to the body of knowledge on sustainable interoperability, according to three main development areas: Enterprise Network Configuration; Architectures and Data Models; and Fundamentals for an Enterprise Interoperability Science Base. Finally the paper discusses the aggregate contributions towards sustainable interoperability, in an evolving technological, business and social environment.</abstract>

<abstract>The advances in information and communication technologies and economic factors impelled organizations to engage in new forms of collaboration, such as collaborative networks. They require adequate frameworks, architectures, tools and platforms to support interoperability among heterogeneous and geographically distributed organizations. Despite the high number of research projects in this area, existing tools and infrastructures, this objective has not been totally achieved. The aim of this research work is to advance the research in the area of interoperability in collaborative networks. A conceptual framework towards seamless interoperability in a collaborative–competitive economic networked environment is described, which comprises six elements: (1) a messaging service; (2) a collaboration profile/agreement definition and management service; (3) five clusters of collaborative activities; (4) a centralized repository; (5) a set of business documents and a set of contracting documents; (6) a performance assessment service. The functionality of the conceptual framework proposed is illustrated with a real implementation case targeting the footwear industry. The proposed conceptual framework is then compared with relevant e-business frameworks.</abstract>

<abstract>To realize truly customer-oriented wearable products, individual users’ unique characteristics and features should be properly captured and represented. This research focuses on an efficient methodology to generate low polygonal virtual human face models, which overcome the limitation of existing high polygonal models. To determine individuals’ characteristics in the conceptual design stage of wearable products, a computerized and personalized 3D face model should be efficiently generated and be able to interact with wearable products. This research formulates a computerized 3D face via a 3D feature-based transformation. The developed algorithm is able to concisely and efficiently create a 3D face by using frontal and lateral pictures of users. The performance of this algorithm is well adapted both to typical PCs and to mobile devices. The generated virtual face models can serve as communication media in a multi-device based collaborative design environment. Through experiments, the validity of the proposed modeling method is considerably acceptable with respect to the quality of the similarity between 3D faces and individual pictures. Finally, this paper discusses how the developed personalized face modeling can be successfully utilized for customer-oriented wearable product design by showing compatible matching of a hairstyle product as a user study.</abstract>

<abstract>Enterprise information systems support and control operational business processes ranging from simple internal back-office processes to complex interorganizational processes. Technologies such as workflow management (WFM), enterprise application integration (EAI), enterprise resource planning (ERP), and web services (WS) typically focus on the realization of IT support rather than monitoring the operational business processes. Process mining aims at extracting information from event logs to capture the business process as it is being executed. In this paper, we put the topic of process mining into context, discuss the main issues around process mining, and finally we introduce the papers in this special issue.</abstract>

<abstract>The need for product customization during product development processes will continue to increase. Product customization can satisfy consumer needs and preferences. Altering the colors and appearance of module parts is an effectual method of achieving product change. Specifically, different color combinations can create a more stylish image. Nevertheless, too many color options overwhelm consumers leaving them unable to make any choice at all. This study presents a decision-making support model that assists consumers in choosing among options and can effectively design products. Factor analysis is utilized to differentiate multifarious products into several styles, which will allow consumers to choose one style according to their preferences. Next, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) combined with the image compositing technique is applied to construct the design decision-making support model provided for choosing the optimum product. Finally, implementation of this proposed model is demonstrated in detail via a case study of leather sofa design.</abstract>

<abstract>The requirements for the interoperability of semantics and knowledge have become increasingly important in Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), in the drive towards knowledge-driven decision support in the manufacturing industry. This article presents a novel concept, based on the Model Driven Architecture (MDA). The concept has been implemented under the Interoperable Manufacturing Knowledge Systems (IMKS) project in order to understand the extent to which manufacturing system interoperability can be supported using radically new methods of knowledge sharing. The concept exploits the capabilities of semantically well-defined core concepts formalised in a Common Logic-based ontology language. The core semantics can be specialised to configure multiple application-specific knowledge bases, as well as product and manufacturing information platforms. Furthermore, the utilisation of the expressive ontology language and the generic nature of core concepts help support the specification of system mechanisms to enable the verification of knowledge across multiple platforms. An experimental demonstration, using a test case based on the design and manufacture of an aerospace part, has been realised. This has led to the identification of several benefits of the approach, its current limitations as well as the areas to be considered for further work.</abstract>

<abstract>Collaboration between suppliers and OEM customers should not be restricted to selling finished components on order. Collaboration should rather go into strategic partnership, covering the whole life cycle of products (see below). The basis for tight collaboration is the agreement on processes, communication and exchange of valuable product information. Within its IndustrialIT initiative ABB is creating valuable product information throughout the whole company in a standardized manner. In order to qualify product information, ABB has installed a certification process, which enables products to carry the quality label “IndustrialIT certified”. Further on ABB has installed the communication and data exchange mechanisms to exchange such product information throughout the whole life cycle of products with the customer. What is needed now for successful implementation is an industry wide agreement on common business processes as an envelope around product life cycle data.</abstract>

<abstract>When competitiveness, responsiveness and customer satisfaction are keywords of a successful management in a business area, companies cannot work in an autonomous way anymore. They have to get closer to their supply chain partners and to optimize their relations, to interface and to integrate their information systems and decision-making in order to synchronize product flows and activities. In this context, the general framework proposed in this paper characterizes the performance of the collaboration in supply chains and it is based on two models: a collaboration characterization model and a collaboration-oriented performance model, both based on main supply chain business processes. The framework proposed has been instanced and validated on an industrial case study.</abstract>

<abstract>Due to the increasing amount of collaborative work in engineering, it is now necessary to create environments that foster the coordination and cooperation among engineering groups. The aim of this paper is to present a methodology to design and integrate ‘Collaborative Engineering Environments’ supported by tools that enable cooperative work and intellectual capital sharing. The resulting methodology to create ‘Collaborative Engineering Environments’ was developed and refined through a set of action research cycles applied to three case studies. The experiences and reflections of every case are described to contribute to a better understanding of how collaborative environments should be built up.</abstract>

<number>1</number>
<abstract>A 3-axis tool path generation algorithm for free-form surface models including defects, such as gaps and overlaps is presented in this paper. To avoid the difficulty of computing a complete cutter location (CL)-surface, the proposed approach generates a tool path by slicing CL-elements instead of a complete CL-surface. A key feature of the proposed approach is that it reduces the number of CL-elements to be sliced by utilizing the correspondence information between CL-elements and cutter contact (CC)-elements. This feature significantly improves the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Empirical tests show that the proposed approach is robust to geometric defects of CAD models, gaps and overlaps, with a near O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of slicing planes.</abstract>

<abstract>From a theoretical point of view, people are used to think that the adoption of innovative business solutions, for optimizing the product lifecycle, should always guarantee a sufficient return on the investment (ROI), even if the concrete benefits that the investment has given to the company are sometimes difficult to evaluate. Looking at the technical literature it is possible to find a lot of ROI's estimation metrics for the evaluation of business strategies, even if after the analysis of the theoretical concepts no one faces with a real implementation of the methodology proposed.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper, we consider discrete event logistics systems (DELS). DELS are networks of resources through which material flow. They have been the subject of a large body of analytic research. A huge variety of specific models exists that generally require application by model and/or solution experts to answer narrowly-defined logistics questions about inventory, sourcing, scheduling, routing, etc. It has, however, proven difficult to integrate these models in any comprehensive way into information systems for logistics because of the lack of conceptual alignment between the models produced by researchers and the information systems deployed in practice with which they should be integrated. In this paper, we systematically identify several challenges for DELS research. We analyse the root of the difficulties for applying academic research results in DELS, and indicate some potential future research directions.</abstract>

<abstract>In the global market, heavy construction machinery manufacturers are transforming their business from selling products to providing services based on their products, i.e. transforming to Product-Service Systems (PSS) business model. This business transformation requires manufacturers to learn past design experience not only on the product design, but also on the product usage and maintenance. Effective knowledge and information management systems can help the business to obtain and reuse the past knowledge in new product design. This study aims to develop an integrated knowledge management and reuse framework for Product-Service Systems business in construction machinery industry. The prototype of such a knowledge management and reuse system has been developed and initially validated. The research shows that the developed knowledge management and reuse system can effectively help Product-Service Systems design for construction machinery.</abstract>

<abstract>Automotive troubleshooting configuration is a critical way to implement the specific paradigm by integrating a set of specific elements to satisfy both technical criteria and users’ needs. With the objective of enabling efficient generation of automotive troubleshooting configuration by reusing configuration knowledge, an ontology-based approach to building troubleshooting configuration knowledge is presented in this study. The utilization of ontologies as metadata descriptions of the information sources is a possible approach to offer an integrated view of multiple elements libraries. A configuration meta-model is defined. The meta-concepts have explicit ontological semantics, so that they assist to identify domain concepts consistently and structure them systematically. As a result, configuration models have well-defined semantics due to the logic semantics of OWL, making it possible to automatically detect inconsistencies of configuration knowledge bases. Actual configuration processes are executed using jess, a rule engine for the java platform, by mapping OWL-based configuration facts and SWRL-based configuration criteria into jess facts and jess rules, respectively. Modeling ontologies of real automotive standard braking system is taken as an example task to show how to use the meta-concepts for configuring the troubleshooting information.</abstract>

<abstract>The paper contains an overview of unique identification issues and of the various radio frequency identification techniques that are available now or will become available in the short term. The paper also compares RFID with traditional ID technologies. It shows application possibilities and gives examples of current implementations. Each application has its own requirements that translate into specific RFID-techniques, -options and -parameters. Techniques include frequency range, tag energy supply and tag writing capabilities. The data to be stored in the tag and transferred to the reader must be selected as one of the options. Parameters influence reliability and confidentiality, among other things. Information interchange issues of identifier-based operations in supply-chains are discussed as well, while the last part of the paper presents a framework for choosing an auto-ID technique in a supply chain.</abstract>

<title>Replicated concurrency control for collaborative feature modelling: A fine granular approach.</title>

<abstract>It is still an open challenge to realize a fine granular concurrency control in a cooperative design (co-design) environment in a fully replicated manner. The fine-grain concurrency control enables multiple users to manipulate well-partitioned portions of a shared product model as opposed to the entire one, where a high degree of operational parallelism is achieved to maximize concurrent collaborations in a natural modelling way. This paper proposes a feature granularity concurrency control approach for the collaborative feature modelling, which supports simultaneous design operations in replicated co-design systems. Firstly, a decentralized mutual exclusion agreement on a single object is extended to a replicated concurrency control mechanism supporting multiple mutually excluded objects. Secondly, a feature granularity concurrency control approach is devised for replicated co-design systems to ensure the consistency of replicated models after concurrent manipulations. Finally, the proposed approach is realized in a real-time co-design environment consisting of multiple heterogeneous computer-aided design (CAD) systems, which proves the feasibility of the approach in the industrial implementation.</abstract>

<abstract>Business Process Management Systems (BPMSs) are software platforms that support the definition, execution, and tracking of business processes. BPMSs have the ability of logging information about the business processes they support. Proper analysis of BPMS execution logs can yield important knowledge and help organizations improve the quality of their business processes and services to their business partners. This paper presents a set of integrated tools that supports business and IT users in managing process execution quality by providing several features, such as analysis, prediction, monitoring, control, and optimization. We refer to this set of tools as the Business Process Intelligence (BPI) tool suite. Experimental results presented in this paper are very encouraging. We plan to investigate further enhancements on the BPI tools suite, including automated exception prevention, and refinement of process data preparation stage, as well as integrating other data mining techniques.</abstract>

<abstract>Consideration of qualitative factors is an integral and necessary part of design optimization. In this paper, we consider qualitative factors as design objectives to be optimized and attempt to optimize qualitative and quantitative criteria together. Interactive evolutionary computation (IEC) provides an ideal platform to include qualitative perspectives of the designer for the optimization of a design. This paper reviews the inclusion of qualitativeness in design, makes the case for its necessity, and classifies qualitative concepts in design optimization, before moving onto a comparison between sequential single objective and multi-objective optimization with regards to simultaneous handling of qualitative and quantitative criteria. The manufacturing plant layout design problem is used as an illustrative example. We further examine the enrichment of the optimization methods by allowing human interaction with the program within the framework of IEC. The multi-objective platform is found to be superior. Finally various challenges, such as the influence of human fatigue, are discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>Due to the highly sensitive business information communicated within RFID-enabled supply chain networks, there is an urgent need for a secure and effective track & trace system. In this paper, we aim to design and implement a secure track & trace system (SecTTS) based on the EPCglobal network where the EPC Discovery Services (EPCDSs) is the most important component. In SecTTS, the EPCDS is designed as a semi-trusted server, contrasting the assumptions of previous works, which requires a trusted EPCDS. Our EPCDS is implemented based on the relay model where set-based relay policy is proposed to allow each supply chain partner to define different relay policies for information with different sensitivity. We implement a prototype of SecTTS and conduct extensive experiments. The results validate that our design is practical and cost effective.</abstract>

<abstract>The paper presents an agent-supported framework for improving solutions for enterprise interoperability and enterprise collaboration. We present and explain the basic approach and system architecture. Special emphasis is put on how agents can support enterprise interoperability as well as enterprise collaboration services. The framework adopts a modeling approach for the description and execution of business processes. With this a system engineer can describe the interaction protocols that should be used at an intuitive level and transform the model down to executable code. Private partner processes can be integrated using a mapping approach to bridge technical interoperability gaps. In addition to modeled service compositions, the framework also supports automatic composition of semantically enhanced services based on a transformation to logic programs.</abstract>

<title>Lightweight design of vehicle parameters under crashworthiness using conservative surrogates.</title>
<pages>280-289</pages>
<year>2013</year>
<volume>64</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>Lightweight design of vehicle structures parameters under crashworthiness is hard to accomplish because of the complexity of simulations required in crash analysis. To reduce the computation demand, surrogates (metamodels) are often used in place of the actual simulation models in design optimization to fit the mathematical relationship between design variables and responses. Each optimization cycle consists of analyzing a number of designs, fitting surrogates for the responses, performing optimization based on the surrogates for a candidate optimum, and finally analyzing that candidate. Even so, optimization using crash analysis codes is often allowed to run only for very few cycles. While traditional surrogate is unbiased which means prediction values at half region is lower than actual values, predicted candidate optimum usually is not feasible after validating by crash simulation. This paper explores the use of conservative surrogates for safe estimations of crashworthiness responses (e.g., intrusion and peak acceleration). We use safety margins to conservatively compensate for fitting errors associated with surrogates. Conservative surrogates minimize the risks associated with underestimation of the responses, which helps push optimization toward the feasible region of the design. We also propose an approach for sequential relaxation of the safety margins allowing for further weight minimization. The approach was tested on the lightweight design of a vehicle subjected to the full-overlap frontal crash. We compare this approach with the traditional use of unbiased surrogates (that is, without adding any safety margin). We find that conservative surrogates successfully drive optimization toward the feasible region of a design space, while that is not always the case with unbiased surrogates.</abstract>

<abstract>Nowadays companies have to face the rapid evolution of their competitive environment. In the field of design, project managers are aware of both the impact of the designers’ competencies on the project performance and of the requirement for a fast development of these competencies. However, they have difficulties in updating competency reference banks and then, in correctly matching the available competencies and missions that have to be performed. This issue of competence management mainly concerns competency allocation and project team building. In research literature, numerous research works suffer from poor competence modelling. Even if some authors have linked competence with work situation, there is often a lack of documentation concerning knowledge capturing about a designer's work situation which would help managers characterise competency. In this paper, we present the architecture of a novel approach based on the traceability of design activities which aims at assisting competency characterisation through qualitative features of the work situation in which this competency is activated.</abstract>

<title>A fast and robust decision support system for in-line quality assessment of resistance seam welds in the steelmaking industry.</title>
<pages>222-230</pages>

<number>3</number>
<abstract>Assessing the quality of a weld in the steelmaking industry is a complex task. The level of complexity increases when the assessment is based on non-destructive tests. Skilled technicians are often required to make a decision based on automatic assessments of welds. Technicians consider the results of the automatic assessments and use their expert knowledge in order to make a final decision about the quality of the weld. In this paper we propose a decision support system to assess the quality of resistance seam welds of steel strips based on statistical analysis of both the mechanical and electrical variables involved in the welding process to be assessed as well as previously recorded historical data of similar welds. The proposed system is designed following component model based software architecture. The system consists of a set of orthogonal modules: welding variable measurement, welding variable processing and welding quality assessment, communicated by means of dedicated interfaces. The proposed system has been installed in three steel manufacturing lines. With the reduction in the time spent by technicians to make a decision about each weld, the productivity of the manufacturing line has greatly improved. Furthermore, production costs have been reduced since the number of defective welds assessed as non-defective was reduced, and thus the failures in the manufacturing lines due to weld breakages. The experimental results after two years of use in a steel strip galvanizing line are shown.</abstract>

<abstract>Due to customers’ constantly increasing demand for personalized products and services, manufacturing enterprises must provide more diverse physical products and services in the product sale stage. However, the massive diversity of personalized products and services offered leads to the internal diversification of products and services, which greatly increases production costs. The application of the modular method can effectively improve the reusability of a product or service, and reduce internal diversification of the product and service. In this paper, the interactive modular design process is established by the analysis of the relationship between a product or service of integrated service product (ISP) and the analysis of the physical module and service module. This paper deals with the module partition principle of ISP, puts forward the three-stages module partition processes and methods, mainly including service module partition processes based on the “Top-Down” and “Bottom-Up” methods, the physical module partition process based on the “Top-Down”, and the module partition methods based on Quality Function Deployment and mapping matrix. Finally, a case study is done on an electric power transformer using proposed principle and methods, and the processes and methods can achieve the interactive module partition of ISP.</abstract>

<abstract>This contribution presents an approach for requirement oriented team building in industrial processes like product development. This will be based on the knowledge modelling and description language (KMDL®) that enables the modelling and analysis of knowledge intensive business processes. First the basic elements of the modelling technique are described, presenting the concept and the description language. Furthermore it is shown how the KMDL® process models can be used as a basis for the team building component. Therefore, an algorithm was developed that is able to propose a team composition for a specific task by analyzing the knowledge and skills of the employees, which will be contrasted to the process requirements. This can be used as guidance for team building decisions.</abstract>

<title>A manufacturing system engineering ontology model on the semantic web for inter-enterprise collaboration.</title>

<abstract>This paper investigates ontology-based approaches for representing information semantics and in particular the World Wide Web. A general manufacturing system engineering (MSE) knowledge representation scheme, called an MSE ontology model, to facilitate communication and information exchange in inter-enterprise, multi-disciplinary engineering design teams has been developed and encoded in the standard semantic web language. The proposed approach focuses on how to support information autonomy that allows the individual team members to keep their own preferred languages or information models rather than requiring them all to adopt standardized terminology. The MSE ontology model provides efficient access by common mediated meta-models across all engineering design teams through semantic matching. This paper also shows how the primitives of Web Ontology Language (OWL) can be used for expressing simple mappings between the mediated MSE ontology model and individual ontologies.</abstract>

<title>Formal component-based modeling and synthesis for PLC systems.</title>
<pages>1022-1034</pages>

<volume>64</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are widely used in industry. PLC systems are reactive systems which run cyclically. In each cycle, the system state is checked and the program is executed once to determine the system behavior for a single cycle. Development of PLC systems conventionally follows the V-model, but increasing demand for efficiency and reliability requires a new rigorous and rapid design flow. In this paper, we propose a component-based formal modeling and synthesis method for cyclic execution platforms and apply it to PLC. Our method consists of three main phases: modeling, verification and code synthesis. In the modeling phase, the BIP (Behavior–Interaction–Priority) framework which is flexible and expressive is used as the modeling language. Real-time behavior, which is intensely concerned in PLC systems, can be modeled as well. In the verification phase, the system model is translated to timed automata and checked by Uppaal. Verification helps to ensure correctness of the model and further increases reliability of the implementation. In the code synthesis phase, the software part of the system model is extracted and synthesized to cyclic code. Although the PLC software runs cyclically, the software model is not necessarily given in a cyclic manner. We propose an algorithm which can generate high-performance cyclic code from a model which describes the business work-flow. This feature significantly simplifies program development. A set of tools is implemented to support our design flow and they are applied to an industrial case study for a PLC system that controls dozens of physical devices in a huge palace.</abstract>

<title>A modeling framework for agile and interoperable virtual enterprises.</title>

<volume>57</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>The virtual enterprise (VE), in general collaborations among business partners in value chains, has become a prime candidate model for competitiveness under the increasingly turbulent business environment. In order to quickly respond to the rapidly changing business environment, agility and interoperability are the main requirements for the VEs. This paper suggests a framework for designing the agile and interoperable VEs. Existing approaches, such as enterprise architecture, model driven architecture, domain specific methodology, meta-modeling, framework-based development, etc., are reviewed, revealing that none offers a complete solution that supports all the aspects of the VE modeling in an elegant manner. Thus, this paper develops a systematic modeling framework by harmonizing these approaches and combining the individual advantages of each approach to produce integrated synergy effects. This modeling framework can be used for business managers or business domain experts to build an agile and interoperable VE quickly and systematically with insights. It also supports a coherent enterprise modeling in which various stakeholders having their own aspects and methodology, such as an IT manager and a business manager, can communicate effectively.</abstract>

<title>Hybrid client-server architecture and control techniques for collaborative product development using haptic interfaces.</title>
<pages>83-96</pages>
<year>2010</year>
<volume>61</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>In this paper, a collaborative product development and prototyping framework is proposed by using distributed haptic interfaces along with deformable objects modeling. Collaborative Virtual Environment (CVE) is a promising technique for industrial product development and virtual prototyping. Network control problems such as network traffic and network delay in communication have greatly limited collaborative virtual environment applications. The problems become more difficult when high-update-rate haptic interfaces and computation intensive deformable objects modeling are integrated into CVEs for intuitive manipulation and enhanced realism. A hybrid network architecture is proposed to balance the computational burden of haptic rendering and deformable object simulation. Adaptive artificial time compensation is used to reduce the time discrepancy between the server and the client. Interpolation and extrapolation approaches are used to synchronize graphic and haptic data transmitted over the network. The proposed techniques can be used for collaborative product development, virtual assembly, remote product simulation and other collaborative virtual environments where both haptic interfaces and deformable object models are involved.</abstract>

<abstract>Practically every major company with a retail operation has its own web site and online sales facilities. This paper describes a toolset that exploits web usage data mining techniques to identify customer Internet browsing patterns. These patterns are then used to underpin a personalised product recommendation system for online sales. Within the architecture, a Kohonen neural network or self-organizing map (SOM) has been trained for use both offline, to discover user group profiles, and in real-time to examine active user click stream data, make a match to a specific user group, and recommend a unique set of product browsing options appropriate to an individual user. Our work demonstrates that this approach can overcome the scalability problem that is common among these types of system. Our results also show that a personalised recommender system powered by the SOM predictive model is able to produce consistent recommendations.</abstract>

<abstract>In order to compete successfully, operations in any type of firm need to be strategically aligned to the market requirements. This concerns both manufacturing and supply chain operations. The customer order decoupling point (CODP) is getting increasing attention as an important input to the design of manufacturing operations as well as supply chains. This paper investigates the impact of the position and role of the CODP on issues of concern for production and supply chain management. The focus is on the design and strategic planning aspects of the supply chain, and the design of manufacturing planning and control systems. The paper proposes a dual design approach for production and supply chain planning systems; one type of system for operations upstream the CODP and another type of system for downstream operations in order to fully support the characteristics and objectives of each respective part of the supply chain.</abstract>

<abstract>The increase in the number of counterfeits penetrating into the open market has created the need for a product authentication approach in tracing and tracking the product anytime, anywhere. Owing to the vague concepts frequently represented in flow of products, this paper presents a self-valuation and visualization system by integrating the RFID technology and EPC concept to protect products from counterfeiting by the means of mobile platform. In this paper, a system architecture is proposed which is capable of integrating mobile technology and EPC-RFID applications. The implementation roadmap of such system architecture is examined and explained in the context of a case study. The aims of the system are to provide greater visibility of the product logistic flow data and to improve the anti-counterfeit process, from traditional physical identification to self-validated location-based authentication. The case study illustrates the capability, benefits and advantages of using the proposed system, particularly its support of product authentication and supply chain activities in countering the global counterfeit problems.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper examines the effectiveness of the implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) in improving service quality in the Taiwanese semiconductor industry by assessing the expectations and the perceptions of service quality from the perspectives of both upstream manufacturers and downstream customers. The study first establishes a modified service quality gap model incorporating: (i) the downstream customers’ expectations and perceptions, and (ii) the upstream manufacturers’ perceptions of the customers’ expectations and perceptions. An empirical study by questionnaire survey is then undertaken to investigate the gaps proposed in the research model. The results show that service quality gaps do exist in the Taiwanese semiconductor industry between upstream manufacturers that are implementing ERP and their downstream customers. The study shows that the proposed model provides valuable guidance to manufacturers with respect to the prevention, detection, and elimination of the demonstrated service quality gaps. The model thus helps manufacturers to evaluate the contribution of various ERP modules to improved customer satisfaction with service quality and also provides guidance on improvement strategies to enhance service quality by eliminating quality gaps.</abstract>

<title>Immune algorithms-based approach for redundant reliability problems with multiple component choices.</title>
<pages>195-205</pages>

<volume>56</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>This paper considers the series–parallel redundant reliability problems in which both the multiple component choices of each subsystem and the redundancy levels of every selected component are to be decided simultaneously so as to maximize the system reliability. The reliability design optimization problem has been studied in the literature for decades, usually using mathematical programming or heuristic optimization approaches. The difficulties encountered for both methodologies are the number of constraints and the difficulty of satisfying the constraints. A penalty-guided immune algorithms-based approach is presented for solving such integer nonlinear redundant reliability design problem. The results obtained by using immune algorithms-based approach are compared with the results obtained from 33 test problems from the literature that dominate the previously mentioned solution techniques. As reported, solutions obtained by the proposed method are better than or as well as the previously best-known solutions.</abstract>

<title>Data and process requirements for product recall coordination.</title>

<abstract>When an organisation becomes aware that one of its products may pose a safety risk to customers, it must take appropriate action as soon as possible or it can be held liable. The ability to automatically trace potentially dangerous goods through the supply chain would thus help organisations fulfil their legal obligations in a timely and effective manner. Furthermore, product recall legislation requires manufacturers to separately notify various government agencies, the health department and the public about recall incidents. This duplication of effort and paperwork can introduce errors and data inconsistencies. In this paper, we examine traceability and notification requirements in the product recall domain from two perspectives: the activities carried out during the manufacturing and recall processes and the data collected during the enactment of these processes. We then propose a workflow-based coordination framework to support these data and process requirements.</abstract>

<abstract>Current Internet-based technologies enable the operation of extended supply chains (ESCs) and introduce new requirements on managing and sharing product-related information in such ESCs, where product models are the fundamental information source. This paper describes an extension of the product data framework originally introduced by PRoduct ONTOlogy (PRONTO). The extended model provides the foundations for a distributed product data management (DPDM) system and is fully consistent with the idea of managing product information according to two hierarchies: the abstraction hierarchy (AS) and the structural hierarchy (SH). They formalize the data aggregation and disaggregation processes required by logistics planning activities. In this work, the Property and PropertyValue concepts were incorporated into the ontology to handle different types of data.</abstract>

<abstract>Quality in product lifecycle is a new focus in quality management, which holds the promise of seamlessly integrating all the quality data produced throughout the life of a product. There is, therefore, a need to build an integrated quality data model to support all quality processes, sub-processes and activities throughout the whole life of a product and guarantee to trace quality data in the lifecycle. Here, evolution procedures of quality data in product lifecycle are analyzed based on the product evolution process. A multi-layered quality data model framework is proposed to support the product quality control in lifecycle and its evolution course. The model consists of six layers: general bill of material (GBOM), quality data carrier, quality processes, quality activities, quality objects and physical data. Mapped successively among these layers, quality data is integrated in the framework. Techniques and procedures of modeling are explained. Evolution relationship of quality data along the product evolution chain is discussed and data model expression based on UML is proposed.</abstract>

<abstract>Systems Engineering (SE) is an approach for designing complex systems. It is now standardized, applied succesfully and recognized in industry. It is intrinsically a model based approach i.e. it promotes a set of modeling languages, reference models, methods, techniques, and processes allowing to guide and organize the designers work. Particularly, verification process is one of the main standardized processes. It helps the engineering team to detect errors or mistakes, to check solutions, to assume traceability of proof to the different stakeholders, and finally to help to argue and to assume the quality and relevance of the proposed solutions. The engineering team involved in a SE project is provided with various verification techniques and tools e.g. simulation, test, expertise, data analysis, traceabilty matrix, etc. However, the formal techniques used in other domains e.g. in software, automation or in mechanical engineering, remain not really considered to be an advantage in SE for many reasons which are first presented and analyzed in this paper. Second, it presents and illustrates the different components of a formal verification framework called UPSL-SE (Unified Properties Specification Language for Systems Engineering). This framework is based on a set of concepts, proposes verification techniques and is implemented in a platform allowing to complete the current verification toolbox.</abstract>

<abstract>Efficient collaborative product design is crucial for extended enterprises willing to develop complex products pursuing a short time to market. However, successful collaborative product design depends on the ability to effectively manage and share engineering knowledge and data throughout the entire product development process. Co-design software platforms aim to facilitate cooperation in distributed teams. In the context of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) the advanced co-design software implementation to support the supply chain is not a trivial task. SMEs have peculiar characteristics such as flexibility, ICT skills and financial resources, which are difficult to be integrated within a structured design network. This paper presents a method to define and evaluate a co-design platform dedicated to SMEs in the mechanical product field. System architecture is defined by applying suitable metrics based on collaborative process characteristics in order to assess functionality performance of the available tools. Benchmarking is based on different levels of collaboration recognized in the typical product development process in SMEs. Correlation between process metrics, software functionalities and specific collaboration requirements is managed by adopting Quality Function Deployment (QFD) techniques. A practical case study allows the robustness of the proposed method to be verified and the main advantages and future developments to be discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>In many applications, the industrial environments are typically 3-D indoor spaces enclosed by shell style structures, which are highly complex with known or unknown non-convex obstacles. GPS signal is unreliable or even unavailable inside, which poses significant technical challenges for the state estimation of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) performing exploration and modeling tasks in such environments. In this paper, requirements and challenges for 3-D enclosed industrial environments exploration are analyzed firstly, and then state-of-art developments of MAV systems, environment modeling, visual navigation and guidance technologies are reviewed. A robust RGB-D odometry is introduced into the system to provide airborne 6-DOF state estimates of the MAV, which are fused with inertial measurements. Then the fused state information is used to assist the RGB-D based real time 3-D environment modeling. An improved closed-loop RRT based path planning approach (BI-RRT) is developed for information-efficient environment explorations. A flight experimental platform is constructed and the proposed system is validated in flight experiments.</abstract>

<title>An empirical investigation of information systems interoperability business value in European firms.</title>
<pages>412-420</pages>
<year>2013</year>
<volume>64</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>4</number>
<abstract>It is widely believed that the establishment of interoperability of the information systems (IS) of a firm with those of its collaborators (e.g. customers, suppliers, and business partners) can generate significant business value. However, this has been empirically investigated only to a very limited extent. This paper contributes to filling this research gap by presenting an empirical study of the effect of adopting the three main types of IS interoperability standards (industry-specific, proprietary and XML-based ones) on the four important perspectives/dimensions of business performance proposed by the balanced scorecard approach (financial, customers, internal business processes, learning and innovation). Our study is based on a large dataset from 14,065 European firms (from 25 countries and 10 sectors) collected through the e-Business Watch Survey of the European Commission. It is concluded that all three examined types of IS interoperability standards increase considerably the positive impact of firm's information and communication technologies (ICT) infrastructure on the above four perspectives/dimensions of business performance; however, their effects differ significantly. The adoption of industry-specific interoperability standards has the highest positive effects, while XML-based and proprietary standards have similar lower positive effects. Furthermore, these effects of the industry-specific IS interoperability standards are quite strong, as they are of similar magnitude with the corresponding effects of the degree of development of firm's intra-organizational/internal IS, and of higher magnitude than the corresponding effects of the degree of development of firm's e-sales IS. These conclusions provide valuable empirical evidence of the multidimensional business value generated by IS interoperability, its big magnitude and its strong dependence on the type of IS interoperability standards adopted.</abstract>

<title>Incorporating free-form features in aesthetic and engineering product design: State-of-the-art report.</title>

<abstract>The use of free-form shapes has become mainstream to design complex products that have to fulfil engineering requirements as well as aesthetic criteria. Even if today’s CAD systems can easily represent free-form shapes by means of NURBS surfaces, their definition and modification still require a deep knowledge and a great skill in the manipulation of the underlying mathematical models. The implemented free-form shapes design operators are time consuming and do not enable fast modifications. To overcome these limits, some researches have been undertaken to try to adapt the feature concept, successfully adopted for the design of regular shapes, in the free-form domain. It gives rise to a set of free-form features modelling strategies. This paper gathers together the state-of-the-art of these advances. The various approaches are depicted and compared with respect to a very precise set of criteria expressing the needs in aesthetic and engineering designs. The limits and future trends are presented.</abstract>

<abstract>By analyzing the current development situation of open computer numerical control (CNC) system and architecture/component software reuse technology, this paper researches on open CNC system based on this technology. Adopting domain engineering method, a CNC system is always organized with its data communication, which plays a role of key link. Furthermore, from which the reusable architecture of an open CNC system is extracted. Also the architecture is instanced to reusable data communication components, which differs from general architecture. The facet modal sorting, expression, storage and retrieval of CNC system components are introduced. Combined with all useful information as above, the integrated development platform of open CNC system is constructed. Supported by this platform, the workflow of developing open CNC systems includes two correlated courses: the development of reusable CNC components, and the construction of an application system with these reusable components. Furthermore, the real-time capability of a CNC application system on MS-Windows can be tested by this platform.</abstract>

<title>Introducing quantitative analysis methods into virtual environments for real-time and continuous ergonomic evaluations.</title>
<pages>283-296</pages>
<year>2006</year>
<volume>57</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>This paper presents our work on methods to link virtual environments (VE) and quantitative ergonomic analysis tools in real time for occupational ergonomic studies. We pursued two distinct approaches: (a) create methods to integrate the VE with commercially available ergonomic analysis tools for a synergistic use of functionalities and capabilities; (b) create a built-in ergonomic analysis module in the VE. The first approach provides the use of established, off-the shelf tools integrated with the VE to create a hybrid application. This integration is performed through the use of APIs provided by the software vendor and existing Internet and communications technologies. The commercial ergonomics tool and the VE run concurrently and integrate their capabilities. The second approach provides the capability to do ergonomic evaluations in a self-contained VE application. In this method, the required ergonomics calculations are built into the VE. Each approach has its own distinct advantages. The use of a commercially available ergonomics tool integrated with a VE provides significant more capability and should be used where detailed and complex ergonomics evaluations are required. However, the process of integration in this approach is more difficult and time consuming. The self-contained VE application is more suited for simple ergonomic evaluations or in cases where the ergonomics algorithms are readily accessible and easily implemented. The two integration strategies are methodically explained and demonstrated using case studies conducted with industry partners. This integrated capability facilitates integration of ergonomic issues early in the design and planning phases of workplace layouts. It provides functionality beyond the capabilities of current commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions. In addition, it contributes to a new trend in the integration of different technology fields for synergistic use in industry.</abstract>

<abstract>Enterprise performance is, now more than ever, one of the key points for reaching the market success. In order to increase it, economics paradigms focus on how to better manage knowledge acquiring, sharing and update. Knowledge management can be approached with the possibility offered by the sustainability goals trying to optimise different enterprise strategic domains. The modern architecture of information systems (ISs) is based on distributed networks with a grand challenge of representing and sharing knowledge managed by ISs and consequently, to remove semantics interoperability barriers. First, this paper analyses interoperability issues between cooperative enterprise information systems (CEIS). Based on this analysis, the authors propose a conceptualisation approach for semantics discovery and management in enterprise information systems models, based on applying fact-oriented transformation rules. The input of the transformation process is a conceptualised UML class model, reverse-engineered from an implemented model, and transformed into a fact-oriented model (FOM), which makes explicit the finest-grained semantics. Semantics aggregates are then computed for structuring the whole semantics embedded in enterprise applications. They define independent set of concepts with their own minimal mandatory semantics. Finally a case study is proposed to validate the practicability of our approach in a real scaled scenario involving an enterprise resource planning (ERP) and a manufacturing execution system (MES).</abstract>

<abstract>For many years, industrial performance has been implicitly considered as deriving from the optimisation of technological and material resources (machines, inventories, etc.), made possible by centralized organisations. The topical requirements for reactive and flexible industrial systems have progressively reintroduced the human workforce as the main source of industrial performance. Making this paradigm operational requires the identification and careful formalisation of the link between human resource and industrial performance, through concepts like skills, competencies or know-how. This paper provides a general survey of the formalisation and integration of competence-oriented concepts within enterprise information systems and decision systems, aiming at providing new methods and tools for performance management.</abstract>

<abstract>Much has been written on implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in organizations of various sizes. The literature is replete with many cases studies of both successful and unsuccessful ERP implementations. However, there have been very few empirical studies that attempt to delineate the critical issues that drive successful implementation of ERP systems. Although the failure rates of ERP implementations have been publicized widely, this has not distracted companies from investing large sums of money on ERP systems. This study reports the results of an empirical research on the critical issues affecting successful ERP implementation. Through the study, eight factors were identified that attempts to explain 86% of the variances that impact ERP implementation. There was a strong correlation between successfully implementing ERP and six out of the eight factors identified.</abstract>

<abstract>The Australian furnishing industry has been subject to severe competition from global suppliers in the last decade. Supported by the government's Action Agenda, the Furnishing Industry Association of Australia developed the “Production Efficiency Program” to improve efficiency of the industry. The core of the program was three showcase projects demonstrating how return on investment can be achieved with the application of advanced manufacturing technologies. Instead of committing large capital expenditure in IT based manufacturing systems, the showcases started by applying lean manufacturing principles and transformed the business practices to adopting latest IT systems for the planning and control of manufacturing. This paper outlines the innovative aspects of the program, issues tackled and techniques applied to the showcases. The paper also reports a case study of a small furniture company that achieved 30% increase in productivity by implementing a new scheduling system that assisted implementation of lean manufacturing.</abstract>

<title>Computer aided rapid tooling process selection and manufacturability evaluation for injection mold development.</title>

<abstract>Injection mold development lead time has been reduced presently by over 50% by employing rapid prototyping based tooling methods. Rapid tooling methods however, have certain limitations in terms of mold material, accuracy, surface finish, and mold life. The relevant process knowledge, especially for newer routes, is not very well established, resulting inconsistent or inappropriate rapid tooling (RT) process selection and mold design incompatibility. This paper presents a computer aided rapid tooling process selection and manufacturability evaluation methodology for injection molding, supported by mold cost estimation models and RT process capability database. Rapid tooling process selection is based on process capability mapping in quality function deployment (QFD) against a set of tooling requirements that are prioritized through pairwise comparison using analytical hierarchal process (AHP). The mold manufacturability for the selected RT process is carried out using fuzzy-analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP) to identify problem features, if any. This is followed by estimating the cost of RT mold and comparing it with a conventional mold, using cost models developed based on the concept of cost drivers and cost modifiers. The entire methodology has been implemented in a software program using Visual C++ in Windows environment and demonstrated on an experimental mold as well as industrial cases. The proposed methodology enables selecting an appropriate rapid tooling process for a given injection mold requirement, and identifying critical features that could be modified to improve manufacturability, thereby achieving better quality and lower cost of molded parts along with shorter lead time.</abstract>

<abstract>In a competitive and global business environment, it is certainly a distinct advantage to capture the genuine and major customer's requirements effectively. To take advantage of this, the unique way is to analyze customer's requirements systematically and to transform them into the appropriate product features properly. Quality function deployment (QFD) is a well-known planning methodology for translating customer needs (CNs) into relevant design requirements (DRs). The intent of applying QFD is to consolidate the customers’ preferences to the various phases of the product development cycle for a new product, or a new version of an existing product. However, it is more difficult to assess the performance of this process with accurate quantitative evaluation due to its uncertain nature. Moreover, people tend to give information about their personal preferences in many different ways, numerically or linguistically, depending on their background and value systems. In this study, a new fuzzy group decision-making approach is presented to fuse multiple preference styles to respond CNs in product development with QFD in a better way. The approach is illustrated with a numerical example concerning the development of the hatch door of a car.</abstract>

<title>A stigmergic approach for dynamic routing of active products in FMS.</title>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>This paper illustrates the capacity of a stigmergic routing control model to automatically find efficient routing paths for active products in flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) undergoing perturbations. The proposed model is based upon a functional architecture with two levels: a virtual level in which virtual active products (VAPs) evolve stochastically in accelerated time, and a physical level in which physical active products (PAPs) evolve deterministically in real-time. The physical active products follow the best paths that have been detected on the virtual level, with a virtual level exploration being triggered when a perturbation is diagnosed in the transportation system. The data used for the simulation on the virtual level is then updated to reflect the real state of the transportation system. The model's adaptive capabilities are illustrated with several simulation scenarios using NetLogo software, and an on-going real implementation is presented.</abstract>

<abstract>In enterprise firms, enormous amounts of electronic documents are generated by business analysts and other business domain application users. Applications that use these documents are often driven by business logic that is hard-coded together with application logic. One approach to the separation of business logic from applications is to create and maintain business and information extraction rules in an external, user-friendly format. The drawback of such an externalization is that the business rules, usually, do not have machine interpretable semantics. This situation often leads to misinterpretation of domain analysis documents, which can inhibit the productivity of computer-assisted analytical work and the effectiveness of business solutions. This paper proposes an ontology and rule-based framework for the development of business domain applications, which includes semantic processing of externalized business rules and to some extent externalization of application logic. The creation of external information extraction rules by the business analyst is a cumbersome and time consuming task. In order to overcome this problem, the framework also includes a rule learning system to semi-automate the generation of information extraction rules from source documents with the help of manual annotations. The main idea behind the work presented in this paper is to re-engineer very large enterprise information systems to adapt to Semantic Web computing techniques. The work presented in this paper is inspired by an industrial project.</abstract>

<abstract>The requirements from a globalised world demand that enterprises not only shift their paradigm from product-centrism to component-centrism on integrated products, potentiating the need for tight interoperability dependencies, but also that the product specifications and concepts are fully understood by customers and providers in a transparent manner that surpasses the barriers of language, culture and technology. This paper presents the NEGOSEIO framework, which enables service-based interoperability between parties, closely integrated with semantics and business understanding via the use of reference ontologies in the quest for achieving a stronger interoperability liaison. The paper's validation and discussion is performed in its application on the ontology negotiation of business environments in the scope of the EU-funded FP7 project TIMBUS for digital preservation of resources and enduring business continuity.</abstract>

<abstract>Product lifecycle management (PLM) innovates as it defines both the product as a central element to aggregate enterprise information and the lifecycle as a new time dimension for information integration and analysis. Because of its potential benefits to shorten innovation lead-times and to reduce costs, PLM has attracted a lot of attention at industry and at research. However, the current PLM implementation stage at most organisations still does not apply the lifecycle management concepts thoroughly. In order to close the existing realisation gap, this article presents a process oriented framework to support effective PLM implementation. The framework central point consists of a set of lifecycle oriented business process reference models which links the necessary fundamental concepts, enterprise knowledge and software solutions to effectively deploy PLM.</abstract>

<abstract>Shoe-last, a 3D mould used for making footwear, influence the shape, size and fitting of footwear. Current shoe-last design software has focused mainly on reverse engineering of existing shoe-last and modification. Shoe-last designers have generally preferred to design the shoe-last manually due to limitations of design software. In order to solve these problems, a new software based on CATIA platform was developed. The shoe-last model is based on foot shape measurement data and foot biomechanics. Using the existing shoe-last design standards and the sections from existing shoe-lasts, design tables and relationship equations enables the design of shoe-last with different toe type, heel height and custom shoe-last. The design includes comfort and fit aspects as well as design aspect, therefore enables design of aesthetical comfortable shoes. Since the design can be modified instantaneously, the designers could visualize design changes leading to a reduction in shoe-last design cycle.</abstract>

<abstract>One of the main problems in ERP implementation projects is how to align an off-the-shelf software package with the business processes of the enterprise implementing it. The paper proposes a requirement-driven approach, which benefits from reusing the business process design without being restricted by predefined solutions and criteria.</abstract>

<title>Compiling Ladder Diagram into Instruction List to comply with IEC 61131-3.</title>

<abstract>The standard IEC 61131-3 defines four programming languages for PLC, and the Ladder Diagram is the most predominant one among them. As the Ladder Diagram is a graphical language and cannot be directly executed by general PLC processor, most commercial PLC programming systems, e.g. SIEMENS S7, MITSUBISHI Gx Developer, OMRON Gx Programmer, use Instruction List as intermediate language between the Ladder Diagram and the machine instructions of the processor. However, the Instruction List generated by these programming systems fails to comply with IEC 61131-3. In this paper, we present a method to compile a Ladder Diagram into an Instruction List that fully complies with IEC 61131-3. Several unclear aspects of the standard in compilation, such as the use of EN and ENO, the evaluation of EN, multiple coils and topology restrictions, are discussed before the method is presented. The mathematical definition of Two Terminal Series Parallel unidigraphs is proposed for the first time to represent the Ladder Diagram networks that are composed of connections in series and parallel. Based on the property of TTSP, a method is suggested to verify the topology of the Ladder Diagram. Finally, a complex compilation example shows that the proposed method is correct and has the advantages of ease of understanding, modification, and maintenance.</abstract>

<abstract>Engineers in industrial and control sector continuously face problems on developing modern distributed industrial control applications. The latest standard in this domain, the IEC61499, defines a methodology to be used by system designers to construct distributed industrial control applications. New generation Engineering Support Systems (ESSs) are required to support the whole development process. In this paper, a process that introduces new and enhances already defined phases of the IEC61499 development process is presented. Model Driven Development has been adopted and two meta-models have been defined: a Unified Modelling Language (UML) based one that is used in the analysis phase and an IEC61499 based for the design phase. A set of transformation rules, formally defined by means of UML's Object Constraint Language, is defined to ameliorate the transformation process between the two metamodels. The proposed development process is supported by a prototype ESS, namely CORFU ESS, which is used to present a case study.</abstract>

<abstract>In today's global competitive marketplace, there is intense pressure for manufacturing industries to continuously reduce and eliminate costly, unscheduled downtime and unexpected breakdowns. With the advent of Internet and tether-free technologies, companies necessitate dramatic changes in transforming traditional “fail and fix (FAF)” maintenance practices to a “predict and prevent (PAP)” e-maintenance methodology. E-maintenance addresses the fundamental needs of predictive intelligence tools to monitor the degradation rather than detecting the faults in a networked environment and, ultimately to optimize asset utilization in the facility.</abstract>

<title>3D dental biometrics: Alignment and matching of dental casts for human identification.</title>
<pages>1355-1370</pages>

<volume>64</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>9</number>
<abstract>A 3D dental biometrics framework and a pose invariant dental identification (PIDI) technique are proposed for human identification in this study. As best as we can tell, this study is the first attempt at 3D dental biometrics. Using 3D overcomes a number of key hurdles that plague 2D methods in dental identification. 60 Postmortem (PM) samples and 200 Ante mortem (AM) samples taken from multi ethnic Asian groups (Chinese, Indian and Malay) are used in this study. The PIDI technique includes algorithms for feature extraction, feature description and correspondence. The proposed feature extraction algorithm can extract the salient points from the scanned model of dental cast. The proposed feature description and the correspondence algorithm have been tested and shown to be more robust to rigid transformations compared with the related work. Preliminary experimental result achieves 94% rank-1 accuracy in a human-assisted process, while in an automated identification process, the rank-1 accuracy decreases to 80%. In addition, the developed methodology, as it is also feasible to be applied to identifying severely corrupted dental, could promptly provide a potential candidate list in mass disasters before expert investigation. The high accuracy, fast retrieval speed and the facilitated identification process suggest that the developed 3D framework is more suitable for practical use in dental biometrics applications in the future. The limitations and future work are also presented. It could be used adjunctively with the traditional 2D X-ray radiograph identification scheme to improve the efficiency of current identification process.</abstract>

<volume>56</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>Describes the evolution of performance measurement (PM) in four sections: recommendations, frameworks, systems and inter-organisational performance measurement. Measurement begins with a recommendation, which is a piece of advice related to the measures or structure of performance measurement; frameworks can be dichotomised into a structural and procedural typology that suggests structural framework development has outstripped procedural framework development. The basic requirements for a successful PM system are two frameworks—one structural and one procedural as well as a number of other performance management tools. Inter-organisational performance measurement may be divided into supply chain and extended enterprise performance measurement: the former relying solely on traditional logistics measures, while the latter incorporates the structural aspects of the supply chain system and adds non-logistics perspectives to its measurement arena. Finally, the encroachment of the performance measurement literature into the processes related to performance management is examined, and areas for future research are suggested.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents the dimensional verification of encapsulations used to package microfluidic devices manufactured using a 3D printer of photopolymerisable resin. This characterisation has been performed by computed tomography (CT) by comparing newly manufactured encapsulations and samples that have been subjected to test conditions. Thus, it has been possible to draw conclusions both on the deviations of the nominal geometry of the encapsulations and on how this might affect their performance. This paper presents a scheme of dimensional verification from the point clouds obtained by CT. Finally, a combined threshold and scale factor correction technique of the tomography images is shown. This method is based on the simultaneous measurement of objective and master parts with known geometry. The results reveal the improvements achievable in the accuracy, given a particular machine configuration. The conclusions facilitate the improvement of the geometric design of these devices regarding their behaviour under test conditions.</abstract>

<title>Industrial applications of type-2 fuzzy sets and systems: A concise review.</title>
<pages>125-137</pages>
<year>2011</year>
<volume>62</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>2</number>
<abstract>Data, as being the vital input of system modelling, contain dissimilar level of imprecision that necessitates different modelling approaches for proper analysis of the systems. Numbers, words and perceptions are the forms of data that has varying levels of imprecision. Existing approaches in the literature indicate that, computation of different data forms are closely linked with the level of imprecision, which the data already have. Traditional mathematical modelling techniques have been used to compute the numbers that have the least imprecision. Type-1 fuzzy sets have been used for words and type-2 fuzzy sets have been employed for perceptions where the level of imprecision is relatively high. However, in many cases it has not been easy to decide whether a solution requires a traditional approach, i.e., type-1 fuzzy approach or type-2 fuzzy approach. It has been a difficult matter to decide what types of problems really require modelling and solution either with type-1 or type-2 fuzzy approach. It is certain that, without properly distinguishing differences between the two approaches, application of type-1 and type-2 fuzzy sets and systems would probably fail to develop robust and reliable solutions for the problems of industry. In this respect, a review of the industrial applications of type-2 fuzzy sets, which are relatively novel to model imprecision has been considered in this work. The fundamental focus of the work has been based on the basic reasons of the need for type-2 fuzzy sets for the existing studies. With this purpose in mind, type-2 fuzzy sets articles have been selected from the literature using the online databases of ISI-Web of Science, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Informaworld, Engineering Village, Emerald and IEEE Xplore. Both the terms “type-2 fuzzy” and “application” have been searched as the main keywords in the topics of the studies to retrieve the relevant works. The analysis on the industrial applications of type-2 fuzzy sets/systems (FSs) in different topics allowed us to summarize the existing research areas and therefore it is expected be useful to prioritize future research topics. This review shows that there are still many opportunities for application of type-2 FSs for several different problem domains. Shortcomings of type-1 FSs can also be considered as an opportunity for the application of type-2 FSs in order to provide a better solution approach for industrial problems.</abstract>

<abstract>In the new and emerging mass customization (MC) strategy, where companies and clients cooperate either to design or to assemble a customized product or service, there exists a great need for a mechanism to manage and control information flow among the collaborative business units. The aim of this paper is to present the design and implementation of an information system framework for agile interactions between companies and customers in an MC environment. The underlying philosophy of this framework is to combine Internet-based technology and object-oriented programming (OOP), and offer smart tools that allow customers to interact rapidly and responsively with MC production systems.</abstract>

<title>Refactoring large process model repositories.</title>

<abstract>With the increasing adoption of process-aware information systems, large process model repositories have emerged. Typically, the models in such repositories are re-aligned to real-world events and demands through adaptation on a day-to-day basis. This bears the risk of introducing model redundancies and of unnecessarily increasing model complexity. If no continuous investment is made in keeping process models simple, changes will become more difficult and error-prone over time. Although refactoring techniques are widely used in software engineering to address similar problems, so far, no comparable state-of-the-art has evolved in the business process management domain. Process designers either have to refactor process models by hand or are simply unable to apply respective techniques at all. This paper proposes a catalogue of process model “smells” for identifying refactoring opportunities. In addition, it introduces a set of behavior-preserving techniques for refactoring large process repositories. The proposed refactorings enable process designers to effectively deal with model complexity by making process models better understandable and easier to maintain. The refactorings have been evaluated using large process repositories from the healthcare and automotive domain. To demonstrate the feasibility of the refactoring techniques, a proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented.</abstract>

<title>Towards an aggregation performance measurement system model in a supply chain context.</title>

<volume>58</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>This study deals with the supply chain (SC) performance formalization. We propose to build performance measurement systems (PMSs) by linking an overall performance expression to elementary ones. The overall performance is associated to a global objective whose break-down provides elementary objectives. Elementary performances are thus aggregated in a corollary way. The problem in the design of such PMS's, by the break-down/aggregation model, concerns both the coherent elementary performance expressions and the definition of the links between them. Some answers are proposed in the literature, such as the weighted mean aggregation operator, to handle hierarchical links, the Choquet integral operator, for taking interactions into account. As global frameworks, the AHP or MACBETH methodologies are suggested. By considering the SCOR model break-down, we propose to extend here the proposed approaches for expressing the overall performance of a SC. An aggregation methodology, based on the Choquet integral operator and MACBETH framework, is thus adopted.</abstract>

<title>A methodology for creating a virtual model for a flexible manufacturing system.</title>
<pages>734-746</pages>
<year>2005</year>
<volume>56</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>7</number>
<abstract>Proposed in the paper is an object-oriented methodology to create a virtual flexible manufacturing system (FMS) model. The proposed virtual FMS model consists of four types of objects: the virtual device model (object model), the transfer handler model (functional model), the state manager model, and the flow controller model (dynamic model). A virtual device model consists of two parts: shell and core. To improve the reusability of a virtual device model, the shell part is designed to adapt to different FMS configurations. For the fidelity of the virtual FMS model, a transfer handler model has a set of device-level commands imitating the physical mechanism of a transfer. As a result, we can expect more accurate simulation results. The flow controller model makes decisions on firable transfers based on decision variables, which are maintained by the state manager model. For the implementation of the proposed virtual FMS model, this paper employs Discrete Event Systems Specifications (DEVS) formalism, which supports the specification of discrete event models in a hierarchical, modular manner. The proposed virtual FMS model has been implemented and tested with many examples.</abstract>

<title>Supporting conflict management in collaborative design: An approach to assess engineering change impacts.</title>

<abstract>It is characteristic of collaborative engineering design that precedence relationships among design activities contain information flow conflicts. Due to multi-actors interaction, conflicts can emerge from disagreements between designers about proposed designs. Hence, a critical element of collaborative design is to manage the detected conflicts and particularly the impacts once they are resolved. Indeed, the conflict resolution comes up with a solution which often implies modifications on the product and the process organisation. This paper deals with the problem of conflict management process and particularly the impacts of changes once a conflict is resolved. First, a solution is proposed to assess the impact on the product data based on the concept of data dependencies network. Second, this paper quantifies key issues with regards to Concurrent Engineering that enables us to better manage the design process. Strategies to overlap coupled activities are proposed based on the dependencies between the handled data during the design process. Furthermore, prospects to effectively re-organise the execution of design activities are proposed. Key features for a better process re-organization are studied: overlapping rate and multifunctional interaction rate. The author examines, under varying uncertainty conditions, how these key parameters affect the process performance of product development time and effort. Findings and recommendations to optimise the process re-organisation are summarized.</abstract>

<title>A new design paradigm for the development of custom-fit soft sockets for lower limb prostheses.</title>
<pages>513-523</pages>
<year>2010</year>
<volume>61</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>6</number>
<abstract>This paper presents a new 3D design paradigm for the development of specific custom-fit products, such as the soft socket of prostheses for lower limb amputees. It is centered on the digital model of the human body and, contrarily to the traditional process almost manually based, it considers the integration of methods and tools coming from different research and application fields: Reverse Engineering, Medical Imaging, Virtual Prototyping, Physics-based Simulation, and Rapid Prototyping. The paper describes the techniques adopted to acquire and create the digital model of the residual limb, the procedure to generate the socket model, the strategy developed for the functional simulation of the socket-stump interaction and, finally, the realization of the physical prototype. Each design step is described with the related problems and the obtained results. Both trans-tibial and trans-femoral amputees have been considered; however, for now the complete process has been validated for trans-tibial prostheses. Major outcomes of the proposed approach stand in a better quality of the final product, in a shorter involvement of the amputee implying a lower psychological impact, in a limited use of physical prototypes, and in a shorter development time. Moreover, the resulting paradigm answers to the Collaborative Engineering guidelines by optimizing the interaction between different domains and enhancing their contributions in a homogeneous development framework.</abstract>

<title>Performance measurement of the after-sales service network - Evidence from the automotive industry.</title>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>7</number>
<abstract>The after-sales activities are nowadays acknowledged as a relevant source of revenue, profit and competitive advantage in most manufacturing industries. Top and middle management, therefore, should focus on the definition of a structured business performance measurement system for the after-sales business. In addition, since many actors are involved along the after-sale service supply chain, an integrated and multi-attribute set of measures needs to be designed consistently at every level of the supply chain. Nonetheless, little attention was devoted by scientific and managerial literature to this topic. The paper aims at filling this gap, and proposes an integrated framework for the after-sales network performance measurement, and provides an empirical application to two automotive case companies and their official service network. The cases show that performance measurement systems of different supply chain actors should be aligned in order to achieve strategic consistency. In particular, the performance of different actors at the process level of the framework concurs in determining the after-sales service overall performance towards the final customer. In addition, linkages at other levels (mainly the business and activity ones) may be needed or helpful in ensuring consistency between strategic and operational objectives, inside the organisations and thus for the whole supply chain.</abstract>

<abstract>Enterprise Interoperability is the ability of enterprises to interoperate in order to achieve their business goals. Although the purpose of enterprise interoperability is determined at the business level, the use of technical (IT) services to support business services implies that interoperability solutions at both the business and technical level should be aligned. This paper introduces and demonstrates the suitability of an approach based on model transformations to automate enterprise interoperability. We start by considering that a set of enterprises are willing to interoperate in the context of their individual goals. The interactions necessary for their cooperation are then properly captured in terms of a so-called choreography. Our approach allows a choreography to be mapped and transformed to an orchestration, which defines the operation of the actual technical services of the interoperating enterprises. The paper discusses the technical challenges of implementing the transformation, and illustrates our approach with two application scenarios.</abstract>

<abstract>Despite the inter-dependent relationship between them, production scheduling and preventive maintenance planning decisions are generally analyzed and executed independently in real manufacturing systems. This practice is also found in the majority of the studies found in the relevant literature. In this paper, heuristics based on genetic algorithms are developed to solve an integrated optimization model for production scheduling and preventive maintenance planning. The numerical results on several problem sizes indicate that the proposed genetic algorithms are very efficient for optimizing the integrated problem.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper is based on the results from the project PROTEUS sponsored by the French Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany under the label of European Commission Initiative ITEA. It presents the architecture and the basic concepts of an integration platform, which constitutes the framework of systems implementing the tasks dedicated to remote maintenance, as well as other applications, for large and medium scale industrial installation. The approach illustrated here is useful for executing any maintenance strategy by implementing the relevant means for controlling workflow between several system components as well as the component's integration itself.</abstract>

<abstract>We propose an interactive approach for the flexible analysis of detailed state-transition data collected from discrete-event simulation models of logistics systems. To this end, we focus on multidimensional modeling in order to reveal the drivers of time-variant system performance. Online Analytical Processing functionality provides fast and flexible organization, aggregation and visualization of information. We illustrate the advantages of such an approach with data from simulation studies of the Upper Mississippi River waterway system.</abstract>

<abstract>The present paper discusses Life Cycle Simulation (LCS) as a new approach for supporting the design of Product–Service Systems. The increased relevance of the life cycle perspective in modern society calls for more sustainable approaches to design, engineer and construct everyday products and related services. To respond to such a need, designers and engineers may have access to new methods and tools that are able to integrate the life cycle perspective in a proper way. In such a context, simulation – in its wider meaning – could play a relevant role for engineering the life cycle of a product and analyzing the related service networks. Within this context, the paper conducts a state of the art review of existing solutions implementing LCS, in order to identify common characteristics and prioritize next steps to be done for a comprehensive implementation. To this end a reference architecture is proposed.</abstract>

<abstract>Volatile partnerships are becoming popular and important in the global economy with the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the development of e-business and e-engineering. This requires a new generation of collaborative project planning tools to be built. The e-HUBs (e-engineering enabled by Holonomic and Universal Broker Services) project has conceived and developed a novel approach to e-engineering services. Focusing on project preparation and planning, the e-engineering hub facilitates the outsourcing of engineering services and the fast creation of a project plan that can be executed by engineering teams. This paper presents the e-Hub approach to collaborative project planning and illustrates the key concepts and benefits of this approach through a case study produced as a result of the project. The evaluation results are also discussed.</abstract>

<title>Ontology-based structured web data warehouses for sustainable interoperability: requirement modeling, design methodology and tool.</title>

<abstract>The spectacular growth of the Internet and its widespread adoption by worldwide corporations lead to an enormous quantity of heterogeneous, distributed and autonomous data sources. To facilitate the access to these huge amounts of data and make these sources interoperable, two technologies may be combined: data warehousing and ontologies. Data warehouses are designed to aggregate data and allow decision makers in these companies to obtain accurate, complete and up to date information. In the past decade, Data Warehouse Technology (DWT) has been successfully applied in several domains such as telecommunication, retail, finance and many other industries. It supports a wide range of applications throughout the enterprise. The DWT has been largely used to offer sustainable solutions for enterprises. On the other hand, ontologies are models for specifying the semantics of concepts used by various heterogeneous sources in a well defined and unambiguous way. Ontologies exist in various domains (E-commerce, Engineering, Tourism, etc.) and are used to increase interoperability between sources. They may be used to improve communication between decision makers and users collaborating together, by specifying the semantics of the used concepts. In this paper, we propose a methodology for designing data warehousing applications from various sources. Each source has its local ontology referencing a global one. The presence of ontologies has three main contributions: (i) each owner of each source may use it to define his/her requirements, (ii) it reduces most important types of conflicts that may exist in sources and requirements (schematic and semantic) and (iii) it facilitates the sustainable urbanization of the target data warehouse. Our methodology is supported by a case tool facilitating the tasks of data warehouse designers.</abstract>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>This paper describes an innovative optimization approach that offers significant improvements in performance over existing methods to solve shape optimization problems. The new approach is based on two-stages which are (1) Taguchi's robust design approach to find appropriate interval levels of design parameters (2) Immune algorithm to generate optimal solutions using refined intervals from the previous stage. A benchmark test problem is first used to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach. Finally, it is applied to the shape design optimization of a vehicle component to illustrate how the present approach can be applied for solving shape design optimization problems. The results show that the proposed approach not only can find optimal but also can obtain both better and more robust results than the existing algorithm reported recently in the literature.</abstract>

<abstract>Customer-driven product design process is critically an important part of concurrent engineering (CE). Many new principles and approaches, such as quality function deployment (QFD) and axiomatic design, have been introduced to help designers identify the relationship between customer requirements and design characteristics. However, identification of customer requirements and evaluation of design alternatives are still heavily reliant on designer's experience and knowledge. This will affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the customer-driven design process and even make the development of design automation become more difficult.</abstract>

<abstract>Environmental concerns, stricter legislation and inflated energy costs, together yield energy efficiency as an important pillar for virtually every industrial sector. Mindful of this challenge, ISs can act as enablers of energy-based management and intelligent decision support. Based on empirical evidence through two case studies combined with the design of a system prototype, this paper identifies those major functionalities that suffice to characterize an IS as ‘energy-aware’ in manufacturing. The functionalities are classified into two broad categories: (a) energy monitoring and (b) energy-aware analytics and are then combined into a high-level architecture. As a prerequisite for deploying such functionalities, this research presents also an approach integrating energy and operational information flows. Beyond that, the technologies that support the real-time and large-scale handling of energy data are provided. Our effort scales up to introduce a generic framework of a case-independent energy-aware IS.</abstract>

<abstract>At the different stages of the PLM, companies develop numerous checklist-based procedures involving prototype inspection and testing. Besides, techniques from CAD, 3D imaging, animation and virtual reality now form a mature set of tools for industrial applications. The work presented in this article develops a unique framework for immersive checklist-based project reviews that applies to all steps of the PLM. It combines immersive navigation in the checklist, virtual experiments when needed and multimedia update of the checklist. It provides a generic tool, independent of the considered checklist, relies on the integration of various VR tools and concepts, in a modular way, and uses an original gesture recognition. Feasibility experiments are presented, validating the benefits of the approach.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper introduces a research framework of game play based on a review of media enjoyment theories, personality theories, effects of computer game play, and technology acceptance model. The proposed framework suggests that an appropriate fit between characteristics of the player and gaming technology will result in greater enjoyment while social influence may moderate effects of the fit. An empirical study is carried out to investigate the relationship between enjoyment of computer game play and two personality traits (sensation seeking and self-forgetfulness). Hypotheses are proposed. A survey is conducted in two US universities. Results and implications are discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>The paper proposes a new enterprise modelling methodology called ERE-GIO applicable to supply chain reengineering and integration. It is based on two major phases: reverse engineering of the supply chain and then forward engineering. It takes advantages of previous enterprise modelling methodologies, especially CIMOSA. The application of the defined methodology on the logistics flow of an industrial company has allowed the integration of the reverse logistics flows in the traditional supply chain, thanks to the modelling of business processes and the flows related to it.</abstract>

<title>Integration of machine-vision inspection information for best-matching of distributed components and suppliers.</title>

<volume>59</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>Supply networks can benefit from the development of effective exchange protocols to harmonize the integration of distributed machine-vision inspection information. By enabling local inspection information to be used beyond local supplier decisions and by integrating it with other suppliers’ inspection information, an enterprise can garner better sub-assembly and supplier-matching decisions. An inspection information exchange architecture that enables best-matching has been developed. A parallel computer-based simulation using the teamwork integration evaluator (TIE 1.1) showed that a multiple-file-input logic had a relatively shorter processing time, exchange and handling time, than the pairwise-file-input logic for best-matching processes. The information exchange architecture enabled the comparison of suppliers based on quality of parts and cost to manufacture and aided in selecting the supplier, which better meets the needs of the customer. An Information Exchange Protocol: (1) enables better information exchange among manufacturing functions and (2) provides a decision-making tool for part dimensionality control.</abstract>

<abstract>The paper presents an implemented architecture of an intelligent simulation-based real-time control (SRTC) system for industrial applications. The proposed SRTC uses a trajectory tracking strategy inspired from the model-based predictive control approach. Dynamic control law based on the closed-loop feedback correction is embedded. A computer implementation of this control scheme and experiments are conducted for real-time truck dispatching on a surface mine transportation system. Results showed the capability of the SRTC to generate efficient real-time truck dispatching orders at each 120 s. Simulation results demonstrate that managing trucks with such dynamic control law improves productivity. This improvement is reached when the transportation system is under steady as well as transient states conditions. The proposed SRTC makes use of the intelligent metaheuristic optimization search even under tight timeliness constraints.</abstract>

<abstract>It is inherent to food supply chain networks that performance deviations occur occasionally due to variations in product quality and quantity. To reduce losses, one wants to be informed about such deviations as soon as possible, preferably even before they occur. Then it is possible to take actions to prevent or reduce negative consequences.</abstract>

<abstract>The design and development of a Product–Service System (PSS) raises new issues since the service component introduces further requirements than traditional product engineering. Compared to physical products, services are generally under-designed and inefficiently developed. For this reason, approaches such as New Service Development, Service Design and Service Engineering have emerged during the years to support the design and development of service either as a system itself or as a constituting element of a Product–Service System. However, only Service Engineering investigates service design and development with a systematic perspective and with a seamless integration of product and service contents. The purpose of this paper is to provide a holistic conceptualisation and an up-to-date review of the literature on Service Engineering with a specific focus on its adoption in the PSS context. A critical analysis is also performed with the aim to define a research agenda and the most prominent key actions that could give directions for future research.</abstract>

<year>2008</year>
<volume>59</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>4</number>
<abstract>In this paper, an integrated, three-dimensional, finite element package for the analysis and design of power transformers is developed, requiring no prior user experience in numerical methods and magnetic field simulation. The package consists of an automated pre-processor, magnetostatic solver and post-processor. High accuracy, low computational cost, minimization of user interaction and functional interface are the main advantages of the software, rendering it a powerful computational tool for characteristics prediction of single and dual voltage transformers, suitable for an automated design environment. For the development of the package, a particular scalar potential formulation was adopted. This method, in conjunction with the detailed representation of the real transformer geometry enables the achievement of high accuracy with the use of meshes of low density. The computational efficiency is also enhanced by the use of Morse technique for the storage of finite element matrices and Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method for the solution of the finite element equations. The software has been incorporated in the design process of a transformer manufacturing industry for the evaluation of the leakage field and short-circuit impedance. The comparison of its results with measured values indicates the improvement of accuracy in comparison to the existing methodology, resulting in reduction of the design margin. Moreover, its employment has contributed to the decrease of the transformer industrial cycle and production cost.</abstract>

<abstract>Improving product behavioral performance in design process needs an innovative approach to integrate simultaneously most of the trades (safety, reliability, maintainability, etc.). Currently, safety integration is done in the latest phase of design process, to respect safety directives. This late integration causes some contradictions between productivity and safety. These contradictions could be related to technical and organizational problems. This paper proposes an innovative approach that aims to eliminate these contradictions in order to improve product performance in the use situations. This approach is based on 4 steps: systemic safety integration using Working situation model, taking into account the requirements of safety directives and standards; identifying the contradiction resulting from designer's choices and finally resolving these contradictions using adapted methods like TRIZ. An application case is outlined in off-set industry, to show the applicability and usefulness of our approach.</abstract>

<abstract>Over the last few years, we have encountered an exponential growth in online communication opportunities. Organizations have more and more ways to connect and engage with their current or future customers. The existence of more opportunities in connecting to people can be both an enabler and a burden. Being present at a multitude of different channels requires the effective management of a very large number of adapted contents, formats, and interaction patterns fulfilling the communication and cooperation needs of distributed target groups. In this respect, we integrate existing fragmented communication and monitoring approaches into a full-fledged communication model as a basis for an adequate engagement approach. We describe applications of our approach in both the eTourism and manufacturing domain. In this paper, we introduce an approach that will enable communication, collaboration and value exchange of users through a multitude of online interaction possibilities based on the use of semantic technology. Finally, we also compare our approach with existing solutions with respect to the identified challenges in this subject.</abstract>

<abstract>The Semantic Web has attracted significant attention during the last decade. On the one hand, many research groups have changed their focus towards Semantic Web research and research funding agencies particularly in Europe have explicitly mentioned Semantic Web in their calls for proposals. On the other hand, industry has also begun to watch developments with interest and a number of large companies have started to experiment with Semantic Web technologies to ascertain if these new technologies can be leveraged to add more value for their customers or internally within the company, while there are already several offers of vendors of Semantic Web solutions on the market. The essence of the Semantic Web is to structure Web-based information to make it more interoperable, machine-readable and thereafter to provide a means to relate various information concepts more easily and in a reusable way. The Semantic Web acts as an additional layer on the top of the Web, and is built around explicit representations of information concepts and their relationships such as ontologies and taxonomies. Furthermore, Semantic Web technologies are not only valuable on an open environment like the Web, but also in closed systems such as in industrial settings. Hence, these technologies can be efficiently deployed for domains including Web Services, Enterprise Application Integration, Knowledge Management and E-Commerce, fulfilling existing gaps in current applications. This paper focuses on this synthesis between Semantic Web technologies and systems problems within industrial applications. There will be a short review of Semantic Web standards, languages and technologies followed by a more detailed review of applications of Semantic Web computing in industry. The paper covers theoretical considerations as well as use cases and experience reports on the topic, and we also present some current challenges and opportunities in the domain.</abstract>

<title>Will Model-based Definition replace engineering drawings throughout the product lifecycle? A global perspective from aerospace industry.</title>
<pages>497-508</pages>
<year>2010</year>
<volume>61</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>5</number>
<abstract>The Model-based Definition (MBD) approach is gaining popularity in various industries. MBD represents a trend in Computer-aided Design (CAD) that promises reduced time-to-market and improved product quality. Its main goal is to improve and accelerate the design, manufacturing and inspection processes by integrating drawing annotations directly onto a 3D model, therefore obviating the need to generate engineering drawings. However, its implementation throughout the whole product lifecycle has not yet been fully adopted. Traditional engineering drawings still play an essential part in the capture and distribution of non-geometric information. Based on thirty-four interviews conducted within the Engineering, Drafting, Configuration Management, Airworthiness and Certification, Manufacturing, Inspection and Knowledge Management departments from two Canadian Aerospace companies, the objective of this paper is to report on the main barriers that need to be overcome in order to fully implement the MBD initiative. In addition, the necessary elements and specific requirements needed to evaluate the capacities of emergent tools are proposed.</abstract>

<volume>57</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>Slicing a surface colored model is the basis of forming it by Color Rapid Prototyping. It is also a voxelization process. The procedures for slicing a layer are as below. First, calculate the contour polygon of the intersection of each triangular facet and the layer by 3D polygonal clipping, and then calculate the coordinates of its bounding box. Second, find the boundary voxels intersecting the facet in the bounding box. Third, calculate the area of the contour polygon of the intersection of the facet and each of the boundary voxels intersecting the facet. Finally, for each boundary voxel, find the facet with the contour polygon of the intersection of the facet and the voxel being the largest among all the triangular facets intersecting the voxel, and assign the voxel the same color as that of the facet. The proposed method is applicable to the slicing of CAD models in color STL format. It is also meaningful to the development of the method for slicing CAD models in PLY or VRML format.</abstract>

<abstract>Modern car wash systems are generally controlled by light barriers and power measurement sensors. These sensors are directly mounted on the movable parts of the system which result in a slow regulation, leading to non-optimal performance, e.g. in terms of energy, water and detergent consumption or regarding the quality of the result.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents a novel form design and CAD modelling approach to simultaneously support intuitive physical model development such as 3D sculpting, and CAD surface modelling for effective design communication, evaluation and collaboration. The concept of creation of 3D form profiles by simply projecting a set of 2D drawing on a physical model is utilised for generating 3D constraints and converting a single perspective image of the physical model captured by a web camera to a CAD surface model. This method has been implemented and tested in our prototype design desktop system.</abstract>

<abstract>Public authorities and business communities in apparel industry of Hong Kong are looking for an effective method to identify counterfeited products. RFID technology provides a tool to address these problems. This paper presents a new approach using lightweight cryptography and a simple authentication method based on hash function for RFID Class 1 passive tags. Tags are embedded inside apparel products, such as garments or high-value apparel accessories. To determine whether a product is counterfeit, tag authentication on that apparel product can be performed and this will advise us whether the apparel product is genuine or faked. The proposed method has been compared with other basic approaches for tag authentication. It was found that the proposed method is effective and its operation is reliable. The proposed method would be useful to the existing apparel retail applications, particularly in the point-of-sale applications (POS).</abstract>

<abstract>The intermodal transport chain can become more efficient by means of a good organization of drayage movements. Drayage in intermodal container terminals involves the pick up and delivery of containers at customer locations, and the main objective is normally the assignment of transportation tasks to the different vehicles, often with the presence of time windows. This scheduling has traditionally been done once a day and, under these conditions, any unexpected event could cause timetable delays. We propose to use the real-time knowledge about vehicle position to solve this problem, which permanently allows the planner to reassign tasks in case the problem conditions change. This exact knowledge of the position of the vehicles is possible due to the use of a geographic positioning system by satellite (GPS, Galileo, Glonass), and the results show that these additional data can be used to dynamically improve the solution.</abstract>

<abstract>Enterprise risk management is a critical concept in the current business environment that supports use of tools and processes directed toward monitoring and mitigating organizational risks. Many organizations have embraced enterprise systems (ESs) technology for improving organizational efficiency and effectiveness. ESs provide value by identifying opportunities in operations and assist in managing risks through context sensitive analyses by eliciting relevant information. This research investigates how ES data were transformed into knowledge by a hi-tech manufacturing firm from an ES implementation, and how this knowledge was used to manage risks by utilizing an ES data transformation model from existing literature. Findings indicate that the ES data transformation process resulted from knowledge-leveraging actions at both executive and operational levels. At the executive level, the use of business intelligence module in conjunction with cascades of balanced scorecards helped in assessing progress for achieving goals, and translated decisions into risk-eliminating actions at the operational level. An initial technology-push approach assisted in creating semantically rich representative process models by simulating risk scenarios, leading to a strategy-pull approach for deploying business strategies and decisions. A value assessment strategic model articulates the knowledge-leveraging processes combining human skills with ES tools to optimize enterprise risks.</abstract>

<abstract>Although there is a considerable number of freight traffic assignment models available, they still tend to lag behind their passenger counterparts in terms of maturity of their scientific knowledge. In order to contribute to the improvement of this state of affairs, the authors developed an innovative traffic assignment model, intended to model large networks with a strategic level of planning, which considers both road and rail transport modes and is not very demanding in terms of data. The model applies two different assignment techniques for the two types of cargo considered, with its main innovative feature being the fact that it takes into account both capacity constraints and a variable perception of costs by users, while being much simpler and lighter than a stochastic user equilibrium model. The simultaneous consideration of both of those factors distinguishes it from the traditionally used traffic assignment techniques, namely all or nothing, equilibrium or stochastic (multi-flow) techniques, none of which considers those factors simultaneously.</abstract>

<abstract>Ontologies are structural components of modern information systems. The taxonomy, the core of an ontology, is a delicate balance between adequacy considerations, minimal commitments and implementation concerns. However, ontological taxonomies can be quite restrictive and entities that are commonly used in production and services might not find room in a official or de facto standard or ontological system. This mismatch between the company's view and the ontological constraints can limit or even jeoparize the adoption of modern formal ontologies in industry. We study the roots of this problem and individuate a general set of principles to relate the ontology and those non-ontological entities that are yet important for the core business of the company. We then introduce a theoretically sound and formally robust approach to expand a given ontology with new dependency relations, which make available information regarding the non-ontological entities without affecting the consistency of the overall information system.</abstract>

<title>STEP-based quality diagnosis of shape data of product models for collaborative e-engineering.</title>
<pages>245-260</pages>
<year>2006</year>
<volume>57</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>Collaborative e-engineering requires different digital tools in different phases of the product development process. However, an interoperability error makes product model data unusable when applying digital tools. Movement toward concurrent and collaborative e-engineering drives the need for assuring the quality of the communicated product model data. In this paper, a quality diagnosis method of the shape data of a neutral file based on a product model including curved surface described in formal language is proposed. The proposed method is based on the standard for the exchange of product data (STEP) technology using EXPRESS-X, which is the mapping language between STEP model data. In order to help create the data quality diagnostics criteria for geometric errors easily, the classification of the quality criteria based on their geometric algorithms is also proposed. The certification data model of the product data is proposed to avoid a tedious checking procedure in the receiver system. Some of the quality criteria, which were published by the Strategic Automotive Product Data Standards Industry Group (SASIG), are rewritten in formal language and applied to the data sets including the error set provided by the Japan Automotive Manufacturers Association (JAMA) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed diagnostics method. The approach based on the formal language is extensible for any phase of the product development process by rewriting the criteria. Not all SASIG criteria have actually been implemented. Future work is to rewrite all SASIG–PDQ criteria into EXPRESS-X schemas.</abstract>

<abstract>Staff assignment is of great importance for workflow management systems. In many workflow applications, staff assignment is still performed manually. In this paper, we present a semi-automatic approach intended to reduce the number of manual staff assignment. Our approach applies a machine learning algorithm to the workflow event log to learn various kinds of activities that each actor undertakes. When staff assignment is needed, the classifiers generated by the machine learning technique suggest a suitable actor to undertake the specified activities. With experiments on three enterprises, our approach achieved a fairly accurate recommendation.</abstract>

<title>An Internet-enabled integrated system for co-design and concurrent engineering.</title>
<pages>87-103</pages>

<volume>55</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>In order to facilitate the product design and realisation processes, in this paper, an Internet-enabled system has been developed to support collaborative and concurrent engineering design by seamlessly integrating three functional modules, i.e., co-design, Web-based visualisation and manufacturing analysis, based on some state-of-the-art Java and Web technologies. In the co-design module, designers are equipped with co-modelling and co-modification facilities to carry out a design task collaboratively. The Web-based visualisation module provides a portal for users, who are not involved in the co-modelling process directly, to view and analyse a design part conveniently. Services in the manufacturing analysis module can be invoked by users dynamically to evaluate and optimise the manufacturing costs and the manufacturability of a design part so as to implement the concurrent engineering methodology during a co-design process. This system can be used for a design team geographically distributed to organise a 3D collaborative and concurrent engineering design effectively, and the proposed distributed and integration architectures enable the system to be generic, open and scalable.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper presents a reactive scheduling approach for flexible manufacturing systems, which integrates the overall energy consumption of the production. This work is justified by the growing needs of manufacturers for energy-aware control, due to new important environmental criteria, which holds true in the context of high reactivity. It makes production hard to predict. The proposed reactive scheduling model is based on potential fields. In this model, resources that sense the intentions from products are able to switch to standby mode to avoid useless energy consumption and emit fields to attract products. Simulations are provided, featuring three indicators: makespan, overall energy consumption and the number of resource switches. Real experiments were carried out to illustrate the feasibility of the approach on a real system and validate the simulation results.</abstract>

<abstract>The use of RFID technology affords an opportunity for greater visibility in the supply chain and further supply chain automation, making the processes more streamlined, providing accurate and timely automatic data capture, thereby improving shipment reliability. This paper provides a case study of an RFID-enabled supply chain ecosystem focusing on a large high tech multi-national corporation based in Singapore. Specifically, the paper provides an implementation framework for the Return on Investment (ROI) calculator which trades off labor cost and productivity gains. The Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) methodology is used to assess the operational level benefits of RFID implementation. We show how scalability is critical for RFID adoption.</abstract>

<abstract>Business process modelling is an essential part of developing an enterprise information system. There are many modelling methods with software support currently available on the market. Each individual method has its own advantages and disadvantages but always has the limitation of only representing a certain view of enterprise. To describe a system clearly from different perspectives and to provide a complete understanding of the business process both to the developer and to the end-user, it is necessary to adopt more than one kind of modelling technique to establish a set of graphical models describing a system from different views.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper reports on a collaborative product development and knowledge management platform for small to medium enterprises. It has been recognised that current product lifecycle management (PLM) implementations are document oriented, have a non-customisable data model and inter-enterprise integration difficulties. To overcome these, an ontological knowledge management methodology utilising the semantic web initiative data formats was added to a PLM and an open source alternative. Shortcomings of centralised architectures are highlighted and a solution using a de-centralised architecture proposed. This is implementable at low cost; the scalability increases in line with user numbers. Ontologies, rules and workflows are reusable and extendable.</abstract>

<abstract>There has been a lot of research focused on performance measurement in general. In the last few decades a number of successful studies were reported in implementing performance measurement. However, very few studies were reported on performance measurement in businesses operating in construction industry. Hence the objective of this paper is to implement performance measurement in a business operating in the construction sector using action research. This study has shown that by introducing small changes in the construction industry through a structured performance measurement system (PMS) with appropriate management information systems (MIS), there are significant improvements such as successfully addressing all stakeholder requirements, focusing on critical improvement areas as well as bringing cultural changes (proactive management and decision making).</abstract>

<title>Monitoring environmental performance of the forestry supply chain using RFID.</title>

<abstract>It is estimated that wood raw material worth of approximately €5 billion is wasted annually in Europe. The major reason for this is that the raw material is not used in the most efficient way as information needed regarding the wood raw material is not available throughout the supply chain. An automatic traceability system makes it possible to utilise raw material information efficiently throughout the forestry-wood production chain and to maximize the raw material yield, and to optimise and to monitor the environmental impact, by linking the relevant information to the traced objects. This paper describes novel RFID technology and traceability solutions that have been developed for the wood products industry. RFID-marking connects the physical objects with their database counterparts thus allowing automatic tracing of the objects. The architecture is needed to the dynamic and decentralised nature of the wood industry. The developed novel RFID based technology allows tracing of individual logs from the tree felling to the sawing of the logs at the saw mill. By combining the traceability and process information systems, new methods are enabled for analysing the performance of the supply chain. As an example, the environmental performance of a product can be traced and analysed even on an individual level. This means that not only the performance from the own production of a manufacturer will be accessible, but also the upstream processes that constitute the product value chain and the life cycle performance for the product leaving the manufacturer.</abstract>

<abstract>Case-based reasoning (CBR) has shown significant superiority in creative application (innovation) in many areas, especially those strong in practice but poor in theory, such as engineering design. But existing CBR systems have poor semantic understanding, which seriously hampers their creative application. So this paper mainly focuses on the research of case retrieval of CBR system and proposes an intelligent case retrieval method by integrating ontology technology into CBR system. The proposed method has enough semantic understanding ability and can help designers find the desired case, from which designers can gain enlightenment and inspiration for developing new ideas. The work of this research is mainly that adopt the combination of two ontology acquisition means to improve domain knowledge acquisition and propose a new semantic retrieval method to improve semantic understanding of case retrieval. At last a kind of typical engineering design – injection mold design is taken an example to validate the proposed method and Lots of experiments are organized to test the performance and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing models.</abstract>

<title>Block pattern generation: From parameterizing human bodies to fit feature-aligned and flattenable 3D garments.</title>

<abstract>Research on clothing related CAD is blooming rapidly in the last two decades. It speeds up the product development process significantly and shortens the time to market of fashion products. Although many important results have been obtained, particularly in the computer graphics community, the textile industry is somehow reluctance to adopt these results in actual apparel manufacturing. The main concern is the accuracy of the resulted patterns, because the pattern generation processes ignored some important textile material and manufacturing constraints. This paper introduces a method for generating 2D block patterns from 3D scanned body. A parameterization process is first conducted on a scanned body to create a parameterized model, represented by horizontal B-spline curves. A basic wire-frame aligned with body features is then established based on the parameterized model. Proper clothing ease is carefully incorporated into the model by scaling the wireframe to accomplish the desired fit. Based on the deformed wireframe, a 3D flattenable garment is modeled by boundary triangulation. The main contribution of the proposed method is that the created 3D garment blocks are geometrically flattenable to produce accurate 2D patterns with optimized ease distribution to ensure garment fit. The proposed method is validated and compared to two conventional block patternmaking methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is easy to implement and can generate patterns with satisfactory fit. Furthermore, the method can be used to create fit-ensured mass-customized apparel product.</abstract>

<title>An approach to recognize interacting features from B-Rep CAD models of prismatic machined parts using a hybrid (graph and rule based) technique.</title>
<pages>686-701</pages>
<year>2010</year>
<volume>61</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>7</number>
<abstract>This paper presents a new hybrid (graph + rule based) approach for recognizing the interacting features from B-Rep CAD models of prismatic machined parts. The developed algorithm considers variable topology features and handles both adjacent and volumetric feature interactions to provide a single interpretation for the latter. The input CAD part model in B-Rep format is preprocessed to create the adjacency graphs for faces and features of associated topological entities and compute their attributes. The developed FR system initially recognizes all varieties of the simple and stepped holes with flat and conical bottoms from the feature graphs. A new concept of Base Explicit Feature Graphs and No-base Explicit Feature Graphs has been proposed which essentially delineates between features having planar base face like pockets, blind slots, etc. and those without planar base faces like passages, 3D features, conical bottom features, etc. Based on the structure of the explicit feature graphs, geometric reasoning rules are formulated to recognize the interacting feature types. Extracted data has been post-processed to compute the feature attributes and their parent–child relationships which are written into a STEP like native feature file format. The FR system was extensively tested with several standard benchmark components and was found to be robust and consistent. The extracted feature file can be used for integration with various downstream applications like CAPP.</abstract>

<number>5</number>
<abstract>Using digital human model (DHM) in the early phase of design is becoming an important practice nowadays. Thus, how to simulate the realistic human motion and facilitate the motion generation process is always the main concern. This research focuses on generating motions through operational semantics. The Method Time Measurement (MTM) system is used as the basis for defining the operational motion semantics to generate human motions in a digital environment. By using the MTM semantics as the motion command and applying simple rules for locomotion, the upper and lower limb motions and the gesture of a DHM can be generated automatically. The virtual simulation results obtained from this newly developed system can be used to proactively evaluate job and workplace design, as well as conduct ergonomic evaluations.</abstract>

<abstract>Although supported by extensive anecdotal evidence, only recently design-by-analogy has been proven to occur often in problem solving and idea generation. However, the circumstances which facilitate problem solving and creative idea generation by analogy are not well understood and most analogies are not developed by applying a formal design-by-analogy methodology. Furthermore, most software tools which aid in finding and/or explaining analogies are based on manually assembled databases, which require a large amount of interactive work to be constructed and maintained. This paper examines the use of automatically distilled product characteristics, called Product Aspects, as a way to automatically and systematically identify candidate products for design-by-analogy. Case studies illustrate this idea generation methodology for three different target products.</abstract>

<abstract>A new category of tools known as CAI (computer-aided innovation) is an emerging domain in the array of computer-aided technologies. CAI has been growing as a response to greater industry demands for reliability in new products. Some initial CAI ideas and concepts focused on assisting product designers in the early stage of the design process, but now a more comprehensive vision conceives CAI systems as beginning at the fuzzy front end of perceiving business opportunities and customer demands, then continuing during the creative stage in developing inventions and, further on, providing help up to the point of turning inventions into successful innovations in the marketplace. CAI methods and tools are partially inspired by Innovation Theories, such as TRIZ, QFD (Quality Function Development), Axiomatic Design, Synectics, General Theory of Innovation, Mind Mapping, Brain Storming, Lateral Thinking, and Kansei Engineering, among others. The goal of these new CAI tools under development is to assist innovators, inventors, designers, process developers and managers in their creative performance, with the expectation of changes in paradigms through the use of this new category of software tools. CAI, therefore, stands out as a departure from the usual trends. The latest approaches are presented and analyzed to derive conclusions regarding the present status and the future of these emerging tools.</abstract>

<title>New trends on e-Procurement applying semantic technologies.</title>
<pages>797-799</pages>

<volume>65</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>5</number>
<abstract>The present editorial note introduces the concept of e-Procurement and the use of semantic technologies to improve some of the processes involved in electronic purchasing processes. Currently there is a growing interest to boost the use of electronic communications to deal with Business-to-Business (B2B), Business-to-Consumer (B2C) or Administration-to-Administration (A2A) relationships. New technologies are emerging with the aim of: (1) reducing costs; (2) providing more intelligent environments to make decisions in more timely and accurate fashion and (3) improving the overall efficiency of business processes. More specifically, e-Procurement defined as the business to business purchase and sale of supplies over the Internet can be found in a variety of ways from public marketplaces involving many firms to private exchanges that are currently facing a challenging environment to migrate from paper-based systems to an electronic ecosystem. However several interlinked challenges to achieve a successful transition have been identified such as lack of interoperable and standard-based infrastructures (data and services), legal uncertainties including the necessity of improving trust, privacy and provenance of data and information and lack of transparency, accessibility or usability to name a few. In this context semantic-based technologies arise to afford a common and standard data model that eases the interoperability, integration and creation of knowledge-based systems. Taking into account the necessity of a more interoperable and intelligent system to manage e-Procurement processes and the emerging application of semantics in different domains, this special issue is intended to provide researchers, developers and practitioners a summary of the current status of e-Procurement applying semantics.</abstract>

<title>New methods of creating MBD process model: On the basis of machining knowledge.</title>

<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>Traditional machining process planning, which passes manufacturing information through 2D drawing, fails to meet the requirement of current 3D manufacturing environment. Thus, model based definition technology, which uses 3D technology to upgrade the current manufacturing capacity, comes into being. This paper focuses on the creation methods of 3D machining process model. In the first place, the relation between machining knowledge and 3D modeling knowledge has been analyzed, establishing machining ontology and modeling ontology. Then, forward creation method and reversed creation method of machining-knowledge-based 3D process model are proposed. In forward creation method, to drive 3D modeling with machining knowledge, process model is created in commercial CAD platform with modeling ontology transferred from machining ontology for knowledge reasoning through the decision tree constructed from training set and test set. Reversed creation method is established by identifying and suppressing the volumetric machining features and surface machining features after building attributed adjacent graph of process model, and the machining knowledge contained in 3D process model is extracted for subsequent reuse. Finally, the validity of this method is verified with the proposed prototype system.</abstract>

<abstract>Human skin, the outer and largest organ covering our body, can be described in terms of both its 3D spatial topography and its 2D spectral reflectance. Such a characterization normally requires the application of separate procedures using different kinds of equipment, where spectral reflectance can only be obtained from a small patch of the skin surface. This paper investigates the integration of multiple imaging modalities to simultaneously capture both spectral and spatial information from the skin surface over a wide area. By extending the imaging spectrum from the visible to the near-infrared (NIR), we improve general recovery, obtain a more detailed skin profile, and are able to identify the distribution of various principal chromophores within the deeper dermal layers. Experiments show that new dimensions of skin characterization can be generated through the recovered geometrical and spectral information, so that an enhanced visibility of important skin physiological phenomena can be achieved</abstract>

<title>Development of an e-maintenance system integrating advanced techniques.</title>

<volume>57</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>In recent years, globalization and fast growth of communication technologies, computer and information technologies have changed the pattern of maintenance. Accordingly, a new maintenance, e-maintenance has emerged and has been gradually replacing the traditional maintenance. In this paper, a new e-maintenance system is proposed that is dependent upon coordination, co-operation and negotiation through the use of Internet and tether-free (i.e. wireless, web, etc.) communication technologies. This e-maintenance enables manufacturing operations to achieve near-zero-downtime performance on a sharable, quick and convenient platform through integrating the existent advanced technologies with distributed sources. The main difference between the proposed e-maintenance and existing systems is the system structure. This e-maintenance consists of two subsystems: maintenance centre and local maintenance. The relationship of both subsystems can be considered as supplier and clients. This division can effectively reduce maintenance cost, maintenance system design period, and solve the problem of lack of experts. Therefore, the competition of company can be increased due to high reliability of e-maintenance. Some existing modules of this e-maintenance demonstrate its feasibility.</abstract>

<abstract>Data acquisition is the process of capturing and measuring physical data and then converting the results into a digital form that is further manipulated by a computer program. Within the industry, data acquisition systems (measurement systems) are used in a wide variety of fields, including product quality testing. Usually measuring systems are complicated devices, however newer data acquisition systems tend to be easier to use. As such, they open the door for the development of customized software, which can be easily manipulated, not only by programmers but also by domain experts, enabling them to understand and modify programs. Raising the level of abstraction, particularly with those programs that use visual models, can be an effective aid for domain experts, who are then able to model their programs on their own. This paper describes the design and use of a domain-specific modeling language called the Sequencer, integrated with the measuring equipment DEWESoft, which enables domain experts to model their own data acquisitions. Specifically, in this paper the Sequencer is exposed to: domain concepts identification, the construction of modeling notation, a connection with execution framework, and the end-users’ point of view on the modeling tool. The use of the Sequencer will be presented on car brake tests. For this purpose, the Sequencer has already been successfully applied in the automotive industry.</abstract>

<abstract>The importance of interoperability for businesses is undoubted. After an evolution from electronic data interchange to interoperability in electronic business and enterprise interoperability both the scientific and the practitioners’ community are today discussing the notion of interoperability service utilities. Furthermore, researchers are studying decentralized and distributed interoperability approaches such as peer-to-peer networks, for example. However, a comprehensive investigation of business models for such decentralized approaches to interoperability is still missing. Drawing from recent literature on business modeling on the one hand and interoperability research on the other hand this paper designs a business model reference for interoperability services. The business model reference assumes interoperability information as an economic good and is applied in two case studies and evaluated from multiple perspectives. The paper contributes to the scientific body of knowledge as it proposes a novel design artifact which lays the foundation for a number of future research opportunities.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper reviews the available literature on the application of information and communication technologies (ICT), more specifically, Web and agent technologies in condition monitoring (CM) and the maintenance of mechanical and electrical systems. The rarity of experts led to the application of artificial intelligence and, later, distributed artificial intelligence. The Web and agent technology is the latest development in this area. The literature findings have been analysed and classified in a framework which highlights the baseline technology, the objective of the technology and the industry of application. The OSA-CBM (Open System Architecture Condition-Based Maintenance) layers are also used for the analysis of the reviewed work. The review shows that Web and agent technologies are being used for monitoring and maintenance in manufacturing, power, and chemical industries. It is used to integrate geographically distributed systems, processes and heterogeneous data for asset management. Different architectures, methodologies and tools are proposed by the researchers for the development of agent systems. Few findings report the use of the mobile devices. Finally, the review shows that limited consistent and systematic efforts have been made, in an isolated manner, to apply ICT to CM and maintenance.</abstract>

<title>Overcoming the customization-responsiveness squeeze by using product configurators: Beyond anecdotal evidence.</title>

<abstract>Anecdotal evidence suggests that product configurators may be crucial in improving time performance when offering customized products so as to overcome what has been termed the customization-responsiveness squeeze. Large-scale hypothesis-testing studies that either corroborate this finding or discover unpredicted boundaries of validity are still lacking, however. Our paper contributes to fill this gap by testing the positive impact of product configurator use on time performance on a sample of 238 manufacturing plants from three industries and eight countries. The results support the hypothesized impact after the effects of widely acknowledged antecedents of accelerated time performance have been removed. Implications of our findings for both research and practice are finally discussed.</abstract>

<title>Towards product customization: An integrated order fulfillment system.</title>

<abstract>To stay competitive, manufacturing companies nowadays pursue product customization; and configure-to-order (CTO) has been recognized as an ideal business model to implement product customization. Due to the complexities resulting from the large number of customized products, an increased attention has been paid to the order fulfillment process in CTO. However, most of the solutions delivered either focus on own interested areas without considering the impacts from/on the others or approach order fulfillment processes from a strategic level. In view of the limitations of existing solutions and the significance of order fulfillment activity automation and integration, this study considers the entire spectrum of order fulfillment process at an operational level and, proposes an integrated order fulfillment system (IOFS). The IOFS is designed to (1) automatically execute order processing, which is conventionally undertaken in a face-to-face manner; (2) configure products and process plans based on product and process family models; and (3) allow real-time data extraction and sharing of the latest information. Therefore, it assists companies to quickly respond to diverse customer requirements and deliver the expected products at low costs. An industrial example of turn unit assemblies is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the IOFS for product customization.</abstract>

<abstract>The manufacturing competitive environment has intensified in recent years. In this environment, companies do not possess all the knowledge they need but instead rely on other organizations. This results in the need of distance product development, which in turn requires information and knowledge in the place, time and format required. In response to this need the research community has come with a solution called collaborative product development (CPD) systems. This paper introduces the partial results of the ongoing research to propose a knowledge driven CPD system architecture, which will facilitate the provision of knowledge involved in product development. This paper presents the research issues and industrial requirements for such system. Furthermore, the proposed system architecture is described in detail and its implementation is presented using a case study of an injection moulded product.</abstract>

<title>Location Analysis Model for Belgian Intermodal Terminals: Importance of the value of time in the intermodal transport chain.</title>

<abstract>Intermodal transport, the combination and integration of several transport modes, with the use of loading units, is in most cases more environmentally friendly than unimodal road transport for the carriage of goods. The LAMBIT-model (Location Analysis Model for Belgian Intermodal Terminals) has been developed to analyse the market areas of existing and potential intermodal terminals. In the LAMBIT model, barge/road and rail/road intermodal chains can be compared to unimodal road transport within Belgium. In this paper we show how to include, next to market prices, the value of time in the model and how to integrate other factors influencing the cost structure, such as the possibility to use the terminal as an empty depot and implications of the so-called backhaul problem and the distance of the post-haulage section. Different scenarios will be evaluated and compared to the reference scenario.</abstract>

<abstract>Although research has evolved significantly over the last decade, there are still a large number of Grand Challenges confronting modelling, model deployment, and model-based decision making of large-scale complex Discrete Event Logistics Systems (DELS) to be tackled, as identified and reviewed during a Dagstuhl workshop in March 2010. This paper illustrates how several of these challenges are already being addressed, based on a series of case studies from the Aerospace Spare Components Logistics domain, where consolidated operational Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) information can be used for tactical planning and optimisation of spare components logistics networks. In this setting, the growing potential of PHM technology to facilitate the maintenance and support of commercial and military aircraft emphasises the need for tools to determine the impacts and benefits of a PHM system. To achieve this, the prognostics parameters and related logistics policies were identified, modelled, and subsequently incorporated into a simulation-based decision support framework.</abstract>

<title>Process Mining for the multi-faceted analysis of business processes - A case study in a financial services organization.</title>

<abstract>Most organizations have some kind of process-oriented information system that keeps track of business events. Process Mining starts from event logs extracted from these systems in order to discover, analyze, diagnose and improve processes, organizational, social and data structures. Notwithstanding the large number of contributions to the process mining literature over the last decade, the number of studies actually demonstrating the applicability and value of these techniques in practice has been limited. As a consequence, there is a need for real-life case studies suggesting methodologies to conduct process mining analysis and to show the benefits of its application in real-life environments. In this paper we present a methodological framework for a multi-faceted analysis of real-life event logs based on Process Mining. As such, we demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of process mining techniques to expose organizational inefficiencies in a real-life case study that is centered on the back office process of a large Belgian insurance company. Our analysis shows that process mining techniques constitute an ideal means to tackle organizational challenges by suggesting process improvements and creating a company-wide process awareness.</abstract>

<abstract>The measurement of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems success or effectiveness is critical to our understanding of the value and efficacy of ERP investment and managerial actions. Whether traditional information systems success models can be extended to investigating ERP systems success is yet to be investigated. This paper proposes a partial extension and respecification of the DeLone and MacLean model of IS success to ERP systems. The purpose of the present research is to re-examine the updated DeLone and McLean model [W. DeLone, E. McLean, The DeLone McLean model of information system success: a ten-year update, Journal of Management Information Systems 19 (4) (2003) 3–9] of ERP systems success. The updated DeLone and McLean model was applied to collect data from the questionnaires answered by 204 users of ERP systems at three high-tech firms in Taiwan. Finally, this study suggests that system quality, service quality, and information quality are most important successful factors.</abstract>

<abstract>This study presents a systematic approach to developing a knowledge integration and sharing mechanism for collaborative molding product design and process development. The proposed approach includes the steps of (i) collaborative molding product design and process development process modeling, (ii) an ontology-based knowledge model establishment, (iii) knowledge integration and sharing system framework design, (iv) ontology-based knowledge integration and sharing methods development, and (v) ontology-based knowledge integration and sharing mechanism implementation. The mechanism can support collaborative molding product design and process development by providing functions of knowledge integration and sharing. Results of this study facilitate the knowledge integration and sharing of collaborative molding product design and process development to satisfy the product knowledge demands of participants, and thus increase molding product development capability, reduce molding product development cycle time and cost, and ultimately increase molding product marketability.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper provides a conceptual foundation for understanding the production and transport planning process in the automobile sector context. To achieve this, a reference conceptual modelling methodology has been applied. Firstly, the main concepts related to the conceptual models are addressed. Then, a methodology for the identification and analysis of the inputs, outputs, processes and sub-processes of production and transport planning processes is used. Finally, a conceptual model that describes the main flows – products, information and decisions related to the production and transport planning process – in the automobile sector is developed.</abstract>

<abstract>Traditionally, crushed aggregate to be used in construction is graded using sieves. We describe an innovative machine vision approach to such grading. Our operational scenario is one where a camera takes images from directly overhead of a layer of aggregate on a conveyor belt. In this article, we describe effective solutions for (i) image segmentation, allowing larger pieces of aggregate to be measured and (ii) supervised classification from wavelet entropy features, for class assignment of both finer and coarse aggregate.</abstract>

<title>Optimizing customer's selection for configurable product in B2C e-commerce application.</title>
<pages>767-776</pages>

<abstract>Many companies provide configurable products on Internet to satisfy customers’ diversified requirements. Most of business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce software systems use tree- or wizard-like approaches to guide customers in configuring a customized product on Internet web pages. However, customers may feel confused while they are selecting components of a product from option lists, since they are usually not familiar with the technical details of these components. A few e-commerce sites use recommendation systems to provide suggested products for customers, but they have to maintain user profiles and have limitations such as new user problem and complexity. Therefore, they may not be suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises. This research proposes a new approach to help customers configure their expected products. By using this approach, once a customer inputs the levels of importance of requirements, total budget of the expected product, the software system can figure out a customized product which maximally meets the customer's expectations, and can also provide the suboptimal solutions for further selections. A mathematical model to formulate this optimization problem is established. A case study is used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach.</abstract>

<abstract>Performance, as a concept, is a subject open to wide variability as it is a somewhat imprecise word when it functions as a placeholder in research. By using definitions from the Oxford English Dictionary and other research disciplines, this paper provides a wide-ranging discussion of the meaning and content of the term performance in the business performance research. The paper reviews numerous characteristics of performance, such as its being a subjective entity that is non-random in character; while it is governed by its relevance to a particular environment, and operates from a particular objective, by virtue of a set of chosen characteristics. It contains elements that are both static and dynamic; and it is possible to characterise via three states: unformed or random, formalised or systematic, and deformed or over-bureaucratic. Also, an encapsulating model of performance, whereby performance acts as a frame around performance management, performance assessment and performance measurement is proposed. Studies of performance as a concept in itself are practically non-existent in the business research; the value of this paper, therefore, lies in its attempt to explicate previously undocumented models of performance.</abstract>

<abstract>Computer-Aided Inspection Planning (CAIP) has been a research topic for the past 25 years. Most of the CAIP systems were developed for Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs). The authors reviewed these CAIP systems and categorized them into two groups: tolerance-driven and geometry-based CAIP systems. Compared with CMMs, On-Machine Inspection (OMI) systems provide direct inspection in manufacturing and quality control, which is vital for automated production. Since the early 1990s, new CAIP systems have been developed for OMI systems. New technologies were developed in improving CAIP. New product data standards such as STEP and STEP-NC have been developed to provide standardized and comprehensive data models for machining and inspections. This paper systematically reviewed the recent development of these CAIP systems, new standard and technologies. A new notion of integrating the machining and inspection process planning based on the STEP-NC standard is discussed.</abstract>

<title>Knowledge-intensive collaborative decision support for design processes: A hybrid decision support model and agent.</title>

<volume>59</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>9</number>
<abstract>This paper proposes a hybrid decision support model within a multi-agent framework to facilitate integration and collaboration for design decisions. The hybrid decision model integrates the compromise decision support problem technique (cDSP) and the fuzzy synthetic decision model (FSD) to quantitatively incorporate qualitative design knowledge and preferences of designers for multiple, conflicting attributes stored in a knowledge repository so that a better understanding of the consequences of design decisions can be achieved from a more comprehensive perspective. The focus of this work is on the provision of a hybrid decision model and framework for improved cooperative design decision support. The novelty of the work is in combination of different models or methods, algorithms for making collaborative design decisions in both objective and subjective natures, in particular the fuzzy negotiation mechanism using the hybrid decision model. The developed hybrid decision model and framework are generic and flexible enough to be used in a variety of decision problems. Finally, the proposed hybrid decision model and framework are illustrated with applications in collaborative concept evaluation and selection in product family design for mass customization.</abstract>

<abstract>In nowadays industrial competition, optimizing concurrently the configured product and the planning of its production process becomes a key issue in order to achieve mass customization development. However, if many studies have addressed these two problems separately, very few have considered them concurrently. We therefore consider in this article a multi-criteria optimization problem that follows an interactive configuration and planning process. The configuration and planning problems are considered as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). After some recalls about this two-step approach, we propose to evaluate a recent evolutionary optimization algorithm called CFB-EA (for constraint filtering based evolutionary algorithm). CFB-EA, specially designed to handle constrained problems, is compared with an exact branch and bound approach on small problem instances and with another evolutionary approach carefully selected for larger instances. Various experiments, with solutions spaces up to 1017, permit us to conclude that CFB-EA sounds very promising for the concurrent optimization of a configured product and its production process.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper, generic service process designs are presented for handling customer requests within a communication center. The process characteristics which are relevant in this domain are the level of difficulty (standard versus special requests) and the communication channel (synchronous versus a-synchronous requests). The design dimensions are task allocation to generalists and specialists, front-office and back-office role and degree of integration of synchronous and a-synchronous requests. The process designs are evaluated within an experimental simulation study with empirical data from a car rental company. The analysis shows strengths and weaknesses of the process designs under different conditions. Based on these results a model of competing effects is developed which helps to understand the complex dependencies within service process designs.</abstract>

<title>Going beyond 'misfit' as a reason for ERP package customisation.</title>
<pages>606-619</pages>
<year>2005</year>
<volume>56</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>6</number>
<abstract>In an attempt to deal with the potential problems presented by existing information systems, a shift towards the implementation of ERP packages has been witnessed. The common view, particularly the one espoused by vendors, is that ERP packages are most successfully implemented when the standard model is adopted. Yet, despite this, customisation activity still occurs reportedly due to misalignment between the functionality of the package and the requirements of those in the implementing organisation. However, it is recognised that systems development and organisational decision-making are activities influenced by the perspectives of the various groups and individuals involved in the process. Thus, as customisation can be seen as part of systems development, and has to be decided upon, it should be thought about in the same way. In this study, two ERP projects are used to examine different reasons why customisation might take place. These reasons are then built upon through reference to the ERP and more general packaged software literature. The study suggests that whilst a common reason for customising ERP packages might be concerned with functionality misfits, it is important to look further into why these may occur, as there are clearly other reasons for customisation stemming from the multiplicity of social groups involved in the process.</abstract>

<title>Optimal shipping routes and vessel size for intermodal barge transport with empty container repositioning.</title>

<abstract>Despite the growing role of barge transportation in the hinterland access of major seaports in Northwestern Europe, service network design for intermodal barge transportation has received little research attention. In this paper, a decision support model for service network design in intermodal barge transportation is presented. The model determines optimal shipping routes for roundtrip services between a major seaport and several hinterland ports located along a single waterway. Vessel capacity and service frequency decisions may be analyzed by the model. A case study on the hinterland network of the port of Antwerp in Belgium is discussed. The decision support model is applied from the perspective of barge operators as well as from the perspective of shipping lines that offer door-to-door transport services. In the latter case, empty container repositioning decisions are taken into account. Numerical experiments are presented to indicate how the model may be used in practice.</abstract>

<abstract>This article analyzes the results of an 18-month research study examining the implementation of an ERP system within a multinational firm specialised in the extraction and transformation of raw materials. The analysis focuses on the social effects software can have on working procedures and power-sharing structures within an organization. The three principle results show that implementing an ERP system is not a neutral process. Indeed, the ERP triggers fundamental changes in the way managers and assistants organize themselves and it tightens the control of their work. However, it also presents a paradoxical characteristic, managers transgress procedures in order reach their targeted goals. Finally, the rules by which everybody has to play tend to give more importance to specialists, such as purchasing buyers.</abstract>

<abstract>The importance of product information management during the whole lifetime of the product has increased due to the technical sophistication of products as well as stricter governmental regulations for lifecycle management. Just sending the relevant product information downstream in the supply chain does not solve the challenges of product information management of complex products due to difficulties in updating the information and a risk of information overflow in the supply chain. This article describes an agent-based information management model that can be used for managing the information of complex products at a component level in a distributed manner. Further the paper presents an information management platform that can achieve information management requirements by using seven distinct messages.</abstract>

<abstract>Web user clustering, Web page clustering, and frequent access path recognition are important issues in E-commerce. They can be used for the purposes of marketing strategies and product offerings, mass customization and personalization, and Web site adaptation. In this paper, we view the topology of a Web site as a directed graph, and use a user's access information on all URLs of a Web site as features to characterize the user and use all users’ access information on a URL as features to characterize the URL. The user clusters and Web page clusters are discovered by both vector analysis and fuzzy set theory based methods. The frequent access paths are recognized based on Web page clusters and take into account the underlying structure of a Web site. Our method does not require the identification of user sessions from Web server logs, and both a user and a page can be assigned to more than one cluster. Our frequent access path identification algorithm is not based on sequential pattern mining, so it avoids the performance difficulties of the latter. We applied our algorithms to five real world data sets of different sizes. Our results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms with the fuzzy set theory based methods being slightly more accurate.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper describes the development of a multi-material virtual prototyping (MMVP) system, which integrates virtual reality (VR) and layered manufacturing (LM) for digital fabrication of multi-material prototypes to facilitate advanced product development and biomedical engineering. The MMVP system incorporates a topological hierarchy-sorting algorithm, two algorithms for sequential and concurrent multi-toolpath planning, a build-time estimation algorithm, and a virtual prototyping system. Based on the topological hierarchy of slice contours, the sequential multi-toolpath planning algorithm generates sequential toolpaths that avoid redundant tool movements, while the concurrent multi-toolpath planning algorithm generates collision-free concurrent toolpaths to further reduce the build-time. To verify the resulting toolpaths and to facilitate estimation of fabrication cost, a mathematical model is incorporated for build-time estimation of multi-material fused deposition processes. The MMVP system is useful for planning, stereoscopic simulation, build-time estimation and validation of multi-toolpaths, and subsequent digital fabrication and analysis of multi-material prototypes.</abstract>

<abstract>Services based around complex engineering equipment and systems provide substantial challenges in both the long-term management of the equipment and the need for guaranteed delivery of the related service. One of the challenges for an organisation providing these services is the management of the information that is required to design, deliver and subsequently assess the success of the service. To assist in this process this paper develops a model for capturing, organising and assessing information requirements for these Complex Engineering Services in which information required to support key decisions in the life cycle of the service is identified. The model – referred to as The 12-Box Model for Service Information Requirements – is embedded in a three-phase procedure for providing an assessment of information requirements of a service contract which also provides insight into the capabilities of available information systems in supporting the contract. An illustrative example examining service information in an aircraft availability contract is used to demonstrate the use of the 12-Box Model and associated assessment procedure.</abstract>

<abstract>Companies have invested considerable resources in the implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. The results initially expected have rarely been reached. The optimisation (or efficient use) of such information systems is nowadays becoming a major factor for firms striving to reach their performance objectives. After presenting a synthesis of several studies on ERP projects, we build on the findings of a French investigation into the assessment and optimisation of ERP performance. A classification of company positions regarding their ERP use, based on both software maturity and strategic deployment directions, and an improvement process are proposed. Industrial cases allow validation of this approach.</abstract>

<abstract>In this paper we introduce a modelling approach for the optimization of terminal networks, taking into account the costs of CO2 emissions and economies of terminal scale. The optimization problem is solved by bi-level programming, where the upper level searches for the optimal terminal network configurations by using a genetic algorithm, while the lower level performs multi-commodity flow assignment over a multimodal network.</abstract>

<abstract>The fresh products supply chain still has room to improve and increase efficiency and even become an intelligent supply chain by means of automating simple but valuable data flows which will be the foundations and first stage for developing new value-added services. The Spanish company ECOMOVISTAND has developed an innovative and ecological packaging and transport unit, called MT, for the grocery supply chain, which can be used in the entire product cycle; that is, the MT serves (1) as packaging at the producer, (2) as transport unit, (3) as storage at warehouses, and (4) as display stand at the supermarket, all in the same mechanical system, being thus a Returnable Packaging and Transport Unit. An MT needs the support of information technologies to achieve its true potential. In this paper we show the work developed in collaboration with ECOMOVISTAND in order to turn the MT into an intelligent product platform by embedding Active RFID tags. Data flows are integrated into an information system, called MEGASTAND, which allows to track MTs over the entire supply chain and provide value-added services to the customers.</abstract>

<abstract>When managing the problem of new product development (NPD), a firm needs to cooperate with or compete with its strategic partners in a network to survive in the industry. This paper first discusses the critical success factors (CSF) of NPD in a network, and then simplifies 37 CSFs into 10 items within 3 groups by factor analysis and Delphi method. While analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is capable of dealing with the NPD managerial problems by generalizing subjective judgment of experts, it cannot deal with the inter-relationship among factors or the usually imprecise and vague human judgment. To compensate this deficiency, analytic network process (ANP) incorporated with sensitivity analysis, instead of the popular fuzzy AHP model, is proposed, and a firm can make a decisive evaluation by applying the model. However, developing new products with strategic partners in a network is positively associated with efficiency and effectiveness and negatively with innovation. In order to lead a firm to operate efficiently, effectively and innovatively, the product lifecycle management (PLM) including suitable knowledge management (KM) and process development management is advised for the execution of the selected NPD mix. Balanced scorecard (BSC) using ANP with sensitivity analysis is then suggested to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure and models.</abstract>

<abstract>Today, enterprise applications provide large amounts of data and finding the right information on time for a given purpose is often a challenge. In these environments, users do not know what information is important, why it is important and finally, how to find this important information. Therefore, an enterprise application has to decide which information is relevant in certain a situation for certain a user. In order to accomplish that, the context of the information must be taken to account. Moreover, this application must be able to capture the context of the application user as well as the overall business context which describes the situation in which information is relevant. In this paper we propose an ontology-based context model which captures the general concepts about user and business context. Also, we discuss the challenges for context reasoning and interpreting and we present a case study to demonstrate the benefits of the developed concepts.</abstract>

<abstract>In order to manage enterprise businesses effectively, enterprise decision makers need to understand enterprise business processes from various perspectives using sophisticated process simulation and optimization tools. Evaluation of enterprise processes is the basis of enterprise process simulation and optimization research for business process re-engineering. This paper proposes a methodology for dynamic enterprise process performance evaluation with metric measurement models based on Activity-Based Costing and Activity-Based Management (ABC/ABM) for six types of process flows within manufacturing enterprises, including activity flow, product information flow, resource flow, cost flow, cash flow, and profit flow. The proposed methodology uses time, quality, service, cost, speed, efficiency, and importance as seven criteria. A prototype software system has been implemented to validate the proposed methodology.</abstract>

<abstract>Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) technologies have been successfully applied to a great variety of outdoor scenarios but, in practical terms, little effort has been applied for indoor environments, and even less in the field of industrial applications. This article presents an intelligent SWE application for an indoor and industrial scenario, with the aim of improving and increasing the levels of human safety. The base low-level architecture is built on top of wireless sensor networks (WSN) connected to a Sensor Observation Service (SOS). Higher layers in the architecture include services that make real time decisions based on the collected data. Both simulation and experimental results are presented. The paper shows the viability of our approach in terms of performance, scalability, modularity and safety.</abstract>

<abstract>Mass customisation production is a challenge to the existing production management systems. The opportunity to ensure an efficient utilisation of the production system is reduced due to the build to order (BTO) approach which is most often associated with a customisation strategy. Existing software provides little support because they are mostly based on mass production approaches. BTO on the other side has not been subject to the same attention as mass production, and as the problems are slightly different, the techniques of traditional industrial production can only be applied to a limited extent.</abstract>

<abstract>Product development cycles are nowadays tightened to the minimum and submitted to a growing competitive pressure. However, product and process complexities are constantly increasing. This paradox requires new organisational concepts to satisfy customers’ requirements. Design actors are therefore invited to collaborate more and more closely in order to enhance design efficiency. Collaborative design process gathers actors which have to achieve a common objective linked to a new product, information and knowledge sharing, with a high level of activities co-ordination. In this paper, we are particularly interested in the knowledge exchanged and shared during these collaborations. We first identify the types of knowledge characterising a collaborative design process and the need for a framework to manage collaborative design. A model of design context is provided to support design process and knowledge exchanges. The particular case of conflict resolution during collaborative design is studied through the use of a software formalising the designers’ exchanges during a real industrial conflict.</abstract>

<abstract>Scientific computing in complex product engineering design process has the characteristics of being tentative and iterative, which produces large scale intermediate data with heterogeneous formats and complex relationships, and the efficient organization and management of data becomes a bottleneck of product design performance. The concept of business component is introduced in this paper based on the modular analysis of the engineering process, and an integrated data management and storage framework is proposed for efficient heterogeneous design data management, in which XML schema, relational database and design files are synthesized. A network version management model is designed to enhance the design process and design object data management, which can describe both the individual object's evolution process and the inheritance relationships among multiple objects. Furthermore, key operations of version merge, submission and visualization are discussed. Finally the methods and technologies are implemented in an integrated management system for aerodynamic design of aero turbine engines (IMS-DATE).</abstract>

<abstract>Compared to product design, a broader range of knowledge is required to Product-Service System (PSS) design, since both products and services are included in its design space. In this paper, a method for knowledge-based PSS design support is proposed. The proposed method is on the basis of the research on Japanese Service Engineering, which provides design methodology of the integrated provision of products and services. In addition, a prototype of computer-aided design (CAD) system to realize knowledge-based PSS design support is developed. The method and system support the acquisition of new PSS design solutions by integrating knowledge accumulated in a knowledge base. The developed system was applied to a design of an actual service: an accommodation service in Japan. The application result showed that the developed system was useful to support a design of the integrated provision of products and services.</abstract>

<title>Modelling using UML and BPMN the integration of open reliability, maintenance and condition monitoring management systems: An application in an electric transformer system.</title>

<abstract>Maintenance management of an industrial plant has been always a complex activity. Nowadays Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs) help to organize information and thus to carry out maintenance activities in a more efficient way. The emergence of new ICT has increased also the use of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) systems and the application of Reliability Centred Maintenance (RCM) analysis. Each system is proved to provide benefits to the maintenance management. However when all the systems are adopted, the lack of integration among them can prevent the maximum exploitation of their capabilities. This work aims at fulfilling this gap, proposing an e-maintenance integration platform that combines the features of the three main systems. The methodology and the reference open standards used to develop the platform are exposed. UML-BPMN diagrams represent the emerging algorithms of the designed system. The final product, a software demo is implemented in an electric transformer.</abstract>

<abstract>This paper attempts to propose a virtual operating system applied to operation training of manufacturing facility and manufacturing process simulation. The system is based on VRML and browser/server structure, so user only needs to install a free plug-in, and run the package normally via Microsoft Internet Explorer. Initially this paper studies the system framework, structure models and concept models. Then, a communication approach based on VRML, Java and HTML, which is key to realize the virtual operating of CNC machines, has been presented. The algorithm of material removed simulation based on VRML Z-map is also presented in this paper. It has the advantages such as a lower memory requirement, and a faster computation speed. Finally, in order to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, the CNC milling machine has been taken as an illustrative example for the prototype development.</abstract>

<title>A knowledge-based auto-reasoning methodology in hole-machining process planning.</title>

<volume>57</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>

<abstract>In process planning, how to obtain an optimal process planning is the essential of computer-aided process planning (CAPP) system. The main goal of CAPP system is to derive manufacturing features and machining operations from a design model and sequence the machining operations of the part in a feasible (by some technological constraints) and effective (by some economical standards) order. In this paper, we construct a process-planning model (PP model) for the hole's machining, which consists of three parts: the features framework, the precedent relation net and the sequencing mathematical model. The features framework makes a mapping from manufacturing features of hole into its machining operations. A semantic net named the precedence-relations-net reflects the precedence relationships among hole's machining-operations. Some vectors and matrixes are employed to construct a mathematical sequencing model. Usually, a hole should be machined in several operation directions, v1,v2,…,vM v1,v2,…,vM. In each operation direction, vi vi, there are Nl basic geometrical units to be operated, namely, U1l,U2l,…,UNl. For each operation direction, vi vi, a vector and a matrix are defined to memory the process planning and its operation objects. The mathematical sequencing model will generate an optimal process planning in each operation direction by minimizing the number of tool-changes and decreasing the number of operation steps. Therefore, it can shorten processing times and consume less energy. Finally, two hole-machining examples are employed to illustrate our methodology.</abstract>

<abstract>A significant number of passenger information systems for public passenger transport exist throughout Europe at national levels but, regrettably, their trans-national interoperability is very limited. Any passenger information system depends on several underlying heterogeneous information systems; ranging from the management of transport infrastructure networks, public transport infrastructure objects, public passenger transport services, and public transport processes and regulations. Public transport service providers have their own local information systems that should be vertically interoperable with their national passenger information system. In the future, a trans-national interoperability system is anticipated for national passenger information systems when journey-planning across Europe.</abstract>

<abstract>Recent advances in information and communication technologies have allowed manufacturing enterprise to move from highly data-driven environments to a more cooperative information/knowledge-driven environment. Enterprise knowledge sharing (know-how), common best practices use, and open source/web based applications are enabling to achieve the concept of integrated enterprise and hence the implementation and interoperability of networked enterprises. Enterprise integration and interoperability in manufacturing systems is a key concept to face the challenges of these new environments. This paper describes challenges, trends and issues that must be addressed in order to support the generation of new technological solutions.</abstract>

<abstract>Procedural process control is responsible for coordination of control units that perform basic control in a typical industrial control system. Basic control, in turn, performs actions necessary for maintaining a desired state of process variables and equipment. Software in the domain of procedural process control consists of modules responsible for management of startup and shutdown sequences, exception handling and module communication. In this work we present the domain specific modeling language (DSL) ProcGraph together with its corresponding code generation tool that was designed for the development of software in the domain of procedural process control systems. The advantage of using a domain specific language is that not only the programmers, but also domain experts are able to understand and modify the code. The DSL code is self-documenting, as it is expressed in the idiom of the problem domain. In the article we present a formal description of the ProcGraph language. Furthermore, we describe how the formal model is used in the implementation of the automatic IEC 1131-3 code generator.</abstract>

<title>Generating 3D architectural models based on hand motion and gesture.</title>
<pages>677-685</pages>
<year>2009</year>
<volume>60</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>9</number>
<abstract>This paper presents a novel method for rapidly generating 3D architectural models based on hand motion and design gestures captured by a motion capture system. A set of sign language-based gestures, architectural hand signs (AHS), has been developed. AHS is performed on the left hand to define various “components of architecture”, while “location, size and shape” information is defined by the motion of Marker-Pen on the right hand. The hand gestures and motions are recognized by the system and then transferred into 3D curves and surfaces correspondingly. This paper demonstrates the hand gesture-aided architectural modeling method with some case studies.</abstract>

<title>The evolution of a production planning system: A 10-year case study.</title>

<year>2007</year>
<volume>58</volume>
<journal>Computers in Industry</journal>
<number>8-9</number>
<abstract>This paper describes the evolution of a production planning system (PPS) from a simple work sequence generation tool to a useful, sustained scheduling system. Three stages of evolution are described. In the first stage, a Gantt chart sequencing tool was converted to a scheduler's information system. This change was driven by the need to support the scheduler's daily task. The second stage of evolution was caused by an MRP–ERP conversion. The integration and conversion increased overhead and complexity in the job task and hence the tool, including the transformation of the previously integrated dispatching/scheduling task into separate dispatching and scheduling activities. The third stage of evolution has been small continuous improvements driven by management reporting requirements. PPS was developed in 1996 and has been fully operational since January 1997. Two major insights are discussed in this paper: the implications of supporting the scheduling task versus work sequence generation, and the software design requirements for evolutionary change as the software is used in an ever-changing situation.</abstract>

<title>A tale of two trajectories: bottom-up social software adoption in differing organisational contexts.</title>

<abstract>Abstract: The inherent bottom-up nature of social software diffusion differs markedly from the adoption trajectories to which most organisational IT strategies are accustomed. Through case studies in two organisations, this paper presents insights into how adoption of emergent social software platforms may take form, and discusses the implications of two radically different approaches to manage these processes. Our findings suggest that organisations may need to cede control over parts of the IT innovation adoption process to benefit from grassroots initiatives, and rather standardise successful innovations on an ongoing basis to avoid detrimental fragmentation of media usage across organisational boundaries.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper contributes to a formal framework for the automation of production systems. Automatic control systems deal currently with theoretical modelling techniques that aim to formally define the behaviour of a control system when process behaviours and system requirements are well defined. Our approach aims to facilitate a common and consensual understanding of an automated system at the early stage of a systems engineering process. This approach is based on the use UML stereotypes, based on a systemic approach, to globally formalise a production system satisfying the following predicate: Control Systems Requirements ∧ Process Systems Requirements ⇒ Production System Requirements.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Much time is lost in organisations in handling unknown exceptions because organisational models are not current or coherent with reality, and there is a lack of concepts and methods in Organisational Engineering (OE) for a continuous and timely update of models of organisational reality. To address these problems, a renowned methodology for OE – Design and Engineering Methodology for Organisations (DEMO) – is extended, enabling a precise and integrated modelling of three aspects that we consider to be part of the function perspective of an organisation: viability – norms of operation that ensure the viability of the organisation, dysfunctions and exceptions causing the dysfunctions; change – OE processes responsible for generation, operation and discontinuation of Organisational Artefacts (OAs) – e.g., business rules or organisational actors – to solve dysfunctions; architecture – design rules that guide the referred engineering processes, restricting the 'shape' of their end result – OAs.</abstract>

<title>Dynamic hierarchies for business intelligence information retrieval.</title>

<volume>3</volume>
<journal>International Journal of Internet and Enterprise Management</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>Abstract: Information retrieval is a critical function in Business Intelligence (BI) applications. Most business intelligence applications today rely on traditional keyword searching for their primary retrieval mechanism. Keyword searching has been improved over the years via various advancements including indexing, storage optimisation, improved query processing, and advances in hardware. Nevertheless, it still has significant limitations. This paper presents an alternative mechanism for information retrieval, dubbed ''dynamic hierarchies'', and describes how to develop such a system. Cognitive psychologists have found that recognition is typically superior to recall in information retrieval. The dynamic hierarchies that we develop: are based upon a recognition paradigm rather than a recall paradigm; can be constructed using low-cost hardware and software; overcome many of the limitations inherent in keyword searching and traditional static hierarchies.</abstract>

<title>Business grid services.</title>

<journal>International Journal of Internet and Enterprise Management</journal>
<number>1</number>
<abstract>Abstract: Grid services have come to represent the synthesis of web services and grid computing paradigms. Web services provide the means to modularise software, enabling loosely coupled and novel synthesis. Grid computing removes the binding between functional software components and specific hosting hardware, enabling software to be deployed dynamically over a network (e.g., intra-, extra- or inter-net). Applying the constructs of grid computing to the service orientation of enterprise software will allow business service networks to utilise more specialised services. An upper service ontology that enables business grid services to be described and then related to the grid hosting platform is presented. Explicit knowledge is required for enterprise software, hosting servers and the domain that can then be utilised by both SLA and reservation systems. The ontology presented is derived from and validated using a collection of web services taken from leading investment banks.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper proposes a tool integration approach based on Semantic Web technology. In a concurrent engineering environment integrated engineering tools are loosely integrated by interconnecting product model entities stored inside tools to a semantic network. Due to this knowledge-oriented approach, the product knowledge stored inside the distributed semantic network helps engineers to manage product complexity. The implementation follows a component-oriented Web-Services-based architecture.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper addresses a group of business data processing e-commerce simplifying factors that increase the e-commerce procurement process. The aim of this research is to build a model comprising 15 factors that simplify and increase the procurement process by using e-commerce. Survey data from the 133 large enterprises in Slovenia are analysed. On the basis of these research results, the model of e-commerce factors in the procurement process 'business data processing simplicity' has been developed. In this paper, we find that enterprises, which endeavour to have success in performing procurement processes electronically, should simplify the following subprocesses: bidding, access to suppliers' goods or catalogues, ordering from the supplier, order tracking and possible suppliers' requisition request. Respondents from the companies that had been surveyed look for excellent possibilities in simplifying these processes by using e-commerce. Statistical modelling allows for the explanation of interdependencies and codependencies of functional factors in the procurement chain.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Along with the extensive application of network and information technologies in enterprises, Dispersed Network Manufacturing (DNM) is becoming one of the most important manufacturing modes. Because of the obvious dispersed characteristic of the network manufacturing, the workflow management system will be greatly applied in the enterprise business and will become one of the most necessary supporting tools. However, the traditional workflow management systems are far from satisfactory. Especially under the network and dispersed environment, the traditional systems cannot satisfy the special requirements of the DNM. As a result, a new workflow management system for networked manufacturing based on mobile and collaboration technologies (k-WMFS) is presented in the paper. The architecture, features and key technologies of the system are discussed in the paper. The system can help us to improve the working efficiency, track and manage the executing process of cooperative work effectively under the DNM.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Ontologies define a common vocabulary to share domain information. Many researches have proved the importance of ontologies as a main technology for knowledge modelling. Moreover, many authors have emphasised the use of ontologies to augment the effectiveness of the management aspects of e-learning resources. In this paper, we present a set of methodologies and techniques for the definition of a Semantic Virtual Learning Environment (SVLE) whose purpose is to provide customised and contextualised learning experiences. These experiences are achieved exploiting the implicit knowledge modelling of the reference domain through an extensive use of ontology management techniques.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Collecting the data from the listed companies in China from 2005 to 2007, this study examined the impacts of the executives' political networks on business operations, and reveals that under the transition economics system, perks reflect the business damage because of the lack of institutional arrangements. This study found that the political networks in the state-owned companies brought a larger scale of on-the-job expenditure compared with the private companies. We also found that promoting the market reform and accelerating the institutional environment construction could inhibit the demand of political networks, and improve the enterprise performance.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Performance measurement of service operations has unique challenges compared with that in manufacturing operations. Using the insurance claims settlement as an example, this study discusses the complexity of conducting performance measurement for service operations. Data Envelope Analysis (DEA) is then applied to assess the relative efficiency of 14 regional offices of a US insurance company regarding its efficiency in settling insurance claims. Our research emphasis is on how a quantitative method like DEA could assist the existing measurement systems that rely heavily on managerial judgement. The results indicate that the combination of the two methods, quantitative and qualitative, produced a more reliable performance assessment. Accordingly, we discussed the value of using DEA for guiding the improvement efforts along with limitations of its use for assessing the performance of settlement operations. We concluded that DEA can and should complement but not replace the existing experience-based management evaluation.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: While a growing number of organisations are outsourcing their logistics function, few comprehensive studies on outsourcing of logistics in the Middle Eastern region have been undertaken. An empirical research is used to determine issues relating to the extent, commitment, and organisational impact of outsourcing in Saudi Arabia. Results based on the analysis of data indicate that most of the organisations have largely seen logistics outsourcing as positive developments that give them a competitive advantage. The paper concludes with a discussion in the light of technological challenges faced by organisations outsourcing their logistics function as well as the service provider.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The importance of product return has risen in the last two decades as firms face an increased pricing pressure and more stringent environmental regulations. Anecdotal evidence and a few scholarly studies document the importance of product return, but as yet no scale to measure the use of product return practices has emerged. This study using the data from 125 North American manufacturing companies develops a scale for product return practices and tests the influences of several factors on the product return practices. These factors include information quality, manufacturing technology, Just-In-Time (JIT) production, delivery process, cost leadership strategy and supply chain dynamism. The statistical analysis shows that these factors have a significant positive influence on the use of product return practices. Discussion of our findings and future research opportunities are also addressed.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Business Information Technology (IT) alignment focuses the efficient support of business processes by IT. Therefore, existing software artefacts are addressed within business process models. When these process models and the processes, respectively, alter, however, there is need to adjust the supporting software systems. Thus, already during the design phase of business process models, IT artefacts have to be considered. In this paper, we propose an approach aiming at the restriction of freedom in process modelling. Thus, previously defined software artefacts are used already in business process modelling. Therewith, the gap between the business and the IT layer can be closed. To support such restrictions, a meta-modelling method is introduced and its usage for composing Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) services is illustrated.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of the digital divide phenomenon in Taiwanese government agencies. Based on a review of past literature in digital divide, we found most studies merely focused on the household&47;individual. Little attention was given to government agencies. To fulfill the research goal, this study employed the major elements, IT infrastructure, IT literacy, and IT application, to investigate the digital divide in Taiwanese government agencies. A national web-based e-survey was conducted. The effects of agency attributes and technological development on both internal interactivity and external online client services were examined. The sample consisted of responses from 1,769 agencies, representing 43.57% of total Taiwanese government agencies contacted. The results showed that there are significant disparities in internal interactivity and external online client services between different agency levels. The implications of these findings are discussed in the paper.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Currently, e-manufacturing is considered as a new advanced philosophy in manufacturing areas. In order to win the competition in the 21st century global market extended enterprise presented based on e-manufacturing strategy is playing an important role in manufacturing enterprises. As such, this paper mainly concerns on the generation of extended enterprise and the key points include four parts. First point, it introduces the basic concepts of the e-manufacturing and extended enterprise. Second, it presents and develops three kinds of task-allocating strategies and models that are connected with direct assignment, acquaintance and stranger to implement the generation of extended enterprise concerning the specific manufacturing tasks where Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is adopted as an algorithm to carry out the optimal evaluation and decision. Third, it adopts Java web solutions and mobile agent technologies to realise the above-mentioned task-allocating models and prototype.

<abstract>Abstract: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are among the largest information systems (IS) investments made by firms, and the use of such systems is spreading globally. Many researchers have discussed their adoption and implementation, few have investigated the impact of external contextual factors on the success of such technologies in adopting firms. This study aims to fill this gap in research by examining the effects of three external contextual factors, i.e., industry type, industry climate, and national economic climate on ERP success assessment. We obtained data from Estonia and Finland and our analysis shows that industry and national economic climates have significant relationships with ERP success.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Information Technology (IT) is one of the enablers of Knowledge Management (KM). The aim of this paper is to understand mutual influences of IT-based enablers of KM and to identify the driving and dependent enablers. A questionnaire-based survey has been conducted in Indian engineering industries to rank these enablers. The results of the survey and the Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) have been used to evolve mutual relationships among these enablers. It is observed that of all the enablers the internet has the highest driving power and therefore, deserves serious attention by the top managers of the organisations.</abstract>

<title>Creativity as connectivity: a rhizome model of creativity.</title>

<abstract>Abstract: The knowledge-management literature has been weak on theorising the notion of creativity. This paper is an attempt to conceptualise creativity as the series of connections in what French philosopher Gilles Deleuze calls a rhizome; a horizontal network structure wherein all nodes can be connected to one another. This argument is illustrated by the new drug development activities in the pharmaceutical industry. New drugs are developed in four major phases: Discovery (Phase 0) and Development (Phases 1, 2 and 3). In the earlier phases of Discovery and Development, pharmaceutical researchers make connections between various entities and events in order to produce a new candidate drug. All these connections are made in a single plane producing lines of thought that eventually enable the new drug to be registered. The rhizome model of creativity helps to ground the notion of creativity in a coherent ontological and epistemological model and to demystify creative processes. Thus the rhizome is a viable analytical instrument for creativity studies.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The objective of this study is to understand the factors that affect customer loyalty when there is information asymmetry between service providers and consumers. Three constructs of service quality are used to examine the direct effect and the interaction effect of the switching cost on customer loyalty under three different types of service industries. From the 280 successfully collected samples, this study finds that the switching cost is most significant for search services. It is also found that the effects of service quality on customer loyalty vary when the information asymmetry between service providers and consumers is taken into consideration.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Adopting an industry specific focus, namely the field of information systems organisations, this paper discusses how organisational learning and the social aspect of learning technology may provide organisations with the flexible pedagogic approach required towards generating, managing and disseminating tacit knowledge that accommodates the continual learning of an organisation and its members. The paper analyses the industry of Information Systems Development (ISD) and the benefits that learning technology can provide IS organisations that wish to learn from past projects. Generic guidelines are also suggested to organisations addressing the issue of how to integrate learning technology within an organisational learning environment.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: For distributed teams to succeed, individuals must interact successfully within team social networks. To understand individual performance in distributed teams, we consider a multi-dimensional view of individual virtuality and its relationship with centrality in the team's face-to-face network and ICT network. We leverage social network theory and hierarchically analyse data from 254 individuals in 18 teams. We find that members with higher dispersion are less central in the face-to-face network while those with higher ICT use are more central in the ICT network. Centrality in the ICT network, but not centrality in the face-to-face network, is positively related to performance. The results provide insights for academics and practitioners on how to improve individual performance in distributed teams.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: In this paper, a web-based collaborative framework called Wise-ShopFloor (Web-based integrated sensor-driven e-ShopFloor) is proposed. With appropriate open architecture for effective collaboration among a dispersed engineering team, the Wise-ShopFloor can serve real-time data from bottom up and can function as a constituent component of e-manufacturing for remote monitoring and control. This paper presents the basis of the framework for building web-based collaborative systems that can be used for distributed manufacturing. A proof-of-concept prototype system is developed on top of the framework to demonstrate one of its potential applications on shop floor monitoring and control.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Interoperation between business partners is extremely important. However, most product data produced in many firms are considered as ad hoc and are not qualified for interoperation. To solve this problem, this paper has proposed a concept-centric definition transformation approach, which transforms irregular local product definitions from different data sources to a set of canonical local product representations. These canonical representations are thus able to translate these common product representations to what the public can understand, thus, achieving business interoperation between different semantic communities.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Knowledge management encompasses the entire intelligence cycle from planning to reporting. One aspect that is often overlooked or minimised is the inclusion of competitive intelligence. This paper proposes a new concept to fine-tune the process of electronically gathering competitive intelligence â a key activity in knowledge management systems. Most tools are nondiscriminatory in information gathering, and a structured approach is needed to assist managers at all organisational levels in the needs identification process. The proposed multiclass interest profile provides the capability of expanding the coverage of critical intelligence areas to reflect the assorted topics that make up an organisation's information needs. Each component is customisable to make the information that is gathered pertinent to the organisation, and supporting features such as profile expansion and fine-tuning are also incorporated.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: A new transaction system for implementing complex business transactions via the internet has been created. The system includes components responsible for search, market analysis, negotiation, and legal closing, and its implementation. The system is able to quantitatively evaluate preferences of potential customers (tenants and landlords), and define permissible search areas and allowable ranges for bargaining. It can also search all publicly available databases and generate a statistical model that presents current market situation along with future tendencies as they relate to the customer's preferences. Finally, the system can organise interactive multi-party negotiations and formulate suggestions that assist in reaching a compromise.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: To create competitive advantages, international enterprises frequently must consider expanding into foreign markets. When an enterprise decides to enter a new foreign market, its marketing department must deliberate on all relevant aspects of the move and cooperate with other departments to make appropriate marketing decisions. Certain information thus will be requested. Meanwhile, the organisation may have previously made other similar decisions. However, how to apply organisational memory is important for saving resources and preventing mistakes. This work focuses on external environment assessment from a marketing department perspective. This study combines the concepts of intelligent agent, text mining and organisational memories. Moreover, this study also implements a marketing decision support prototype. This prototype can also be used to provide organisational memories of past decision knowledge, or to stimulate new ideas.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper describes the conceptual basis of an inter-organisational Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system for integrated order processing in dynamic business networks. First of all, current constraints of collaborative order processing in business networks are identified. Based on this an innovative inter-organisational information system is specified, which enables integrated order processing as well as collaborative enterprise application integration by the singular connection of network partners to a web platform. Subsequently, four main components of the information system are outlined: an holistic functional reference model of order processing in business networks, semantically dominant data and process standards, a methodology of coordination and an innovative business model. The paper concludes with a discussion of alternative scenarios of realisation for the inter-organisational ERP system.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Successfully implementing enterprise strategic initiatives appears a daunting task since the majority of initiatives fail. This paper submits that the Enterprise Engineering theory and methodology offers a fruitful approach for avoiding failure. Based on viewing the enterprise as a system, the discussed enterprise engineering framework presents three central notions: 1) Enterprise Ontology which concerns the implementation-independent essence of an enterprise; 2) Enterprise Architecture guiding coherent and consistent enterprise design that can be implemented; 3) Operational Rules that define the execution of enterprise activities. These elements of the enterprise engineering framework are clarified and illustrated using a case example.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: An agent-based simulation study is reported to analyse an inter-group conflict in which agents contribute to provide a public good to all of them, and at the same time the different groups compete for an external prize. This mechanism encourages the group members to contribute instead of free riding. A dynamic version of this multi-player game is analysed in which each player is able to increase their contributed amount depending on the condition that the additional contribution improves her payoff or not. We will examine the dependence of the total contribution on the external prize and the timing of the additional contributions.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The measurement of information systems (IS) success have been widely investigated throughout the IS research community. However, the traditional success models need refinements to meet the specificities of the web-based IS. To go beyond this limitation, this study provides an empirical test of re-specified models adapted to the internet context and based on DeLone and McLean#39;s IS success research. Thus, we tested two models using covariance-based structural equation modelling, as implemented in EQS 6.1, to determine the impact of three web-based IS success factors on online customer satisfaction. The results indicate that web system quality, web content quality and web service quality have a direct effect on online customer satisfaction. We found also that web service quality is a central concept and it mediates partially the role of both system quality and content quality.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The network community concept is generally surrounded by substantial hype and enthusiasm, because project visionaries hope computer mediated communication will increase the social capital needed to build sustainable communities and help prevent or reduce community deterioration. The Blacksburg Electronic Village (BEV) is a networked community success story which has inspired the introduction of similar projects around the globe. One aspirant was the Nerang Electronic Village (NEV) project in regional Australia. This paper investigates the community network philosophy and presents a case study of an Australian community's attempt to implement the electronic village blueprint. Comparisons drawn between the successful BEV project and the unsuccessful NEV initiative demonstrate the prototypical social entrepreneurial role required to diffuse community-based technological solutions focused on sustaining regional communities.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This study looks at firms' perceptions of the importance of absorptive capacity attributes in the deployment of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in a supply chain and their relationships with the firms' intentions to pursue supply chain process integration and Information Technology (IT) infrastructure support. Data for this pilot research study were collected using a survey questionnaire administered online to members of the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP). Both the proposed hypotheses were supported in this study using the cluster data analysis procedure. The level of intention to cultivate absorptive capacity attributes, indeed, is positively associated with the level of intention to deploy both IT infrastructure integration and supply chain process integration.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Enterprises cannot fully realise the benefits of Information Technology (IT) by merely automating their existing business processes. Consequently, large-scale organisational changes enabled by IT, including business process reengineering efforts, have become popular. Differences between nations and societies make it critical to understand how institutional and cultural factors influence IT application and the nature of IT-enabled business process change. Unfortunately, the study of cultural issues still represents a rather isolated and underappreciated subdiscipline within Information Systems (IS). This article builds upon Martinsons and Davison (2003) in order to advance our understanding of how societal culture influences specific IS phenomena. Hofstede's five dimensions are employed systematically to develop a set of researchable propositions. A Hong Kong case provides strong preliminary support for the 12 propositions, which represent an agenda for testing theory by researching how culture influences IT application and business process change.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: With the advance of e-commerce, the importance of recommender systems grows larger than before. Collaborative filtering is the most successful recommendation method, but its widespread use has exposed some problems such as sparsity and scalability. To overcome such limitations, this paper proposes hybrid recommendation methodologies based on web usage mining and dimensionality reduction techniques to enhance the recommendation quality and performance of current collaborative filtering-based recommender systems. Web usage mining populates the rating database by tracking customers' shopping behaviours on the web, thereby leading to better quality recommendations. The product taxonomy and SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) are used to improve the performance of searching for nearest neighbours through dimensionality reduction of the rating database. Experiments on real e-commerce data show that the proposed methodologies provide higher quality recommendations and better performance than existing collaborative filtering methodologies.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: For the development of enterprise information systems, the utilisation of a suitable methodology is essential, providing necessary methods and techniques for modelling the business domain and for designing the supporting information systems. Several methodologies exist and are widely applied in practice nowadays, but most of them lack a theoretical foundation. In this paper, we demonstrate an information system development methodology based on the notions of enterprise ontology and business components, and explain it within the conceptual framework called the generic system development process. The methodology allows for reduction of complexity of domain models and for identification of stable business components.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Xerox Corporation implemented a global Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to effectively manage its 52 worldwide manufacturing plants and lay the foundations of future e-commerce solutions. The strategic objective for implementing a global manufacturing ERP system at Xerox is for management to gain insights into real-time financial visibility and total material requirement consolidation. This paper gives an insight into the planning and implementation process of this Oracle Manufacturing and Financial System (OMAF) from the perspective of Xerox's leading electronics manufacturing plant, Southern California Manufacturing Operations, (SCMO) located in El Segundo, California. An efficient implementation model and associated metrics, based on gap analysis, were developed to manage the activities. Gap analysis also proved to be an effective method for balancing the interests of the process owners, end-users, implementers and all other stakeholders of the project.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: We present an agent-based iterated simulation of a simple market structure. The simulation is based on trade and price satisfaction (payoff) functions for both buyers and sellers. The participants are trying to follow the behaviour of those of their neighbours that have received the highest payoff in the previous iteration. This results in trading and transformation of buyers into sellers and vice versa. Equilibrium conditions develop. The ratio of buyers and sellers fluctuates around this equilibrium. We have investigated two cases: slight and strong domination of the price satisfaction over the trade satisfaction. The results show how the global equilibrium condition depends on the local price. The simulation is a special case of the Chicken Game.</abstract>

The ERP Critical Success Factor (CSF) model for medium-sized organisations in developing countries is explained and assessed. The discovery from the field study of the companies is analysed in the context of the literature and sample secondary cases. This analysis is expected to provide valuable guidelines and directions for organisations undertaking or planning similar initiatives.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Business Process Reengineering (BPR) has played an important role in such developing fields as information systems, electronic business, and enterprise resource planning systems over the past decade. The primary objective of this research is to investigate the factors affecting BPR in China as more Chinese companies realise the pervasiveness of BPR in pursuit of global competitiveness. In this paper we find, via statistical analysis based on a survey of Chinese companies, that senior management support, cross-functional communications, cross-unit project team, and training and employee education are top four critical success factors, along with five major obstacles.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Global sourcing operates under the challenges and pressures of intensive worldwide competition. Global sourcing can benefit from the functionality of Electronic Business (EB) by exhibiting more flexible structures and added opportunities in communications and transactions with partners among worldwide supply chains/networks. This study aims to answer two research questions, ''What are the relationships between global sourcing and EB?'' and ''How do EB applications and strategies help global sourcing lead to better performance?'' Our literature review addresses the relationships between global sourcing and EB from three perspectives: the applied theories, the covered business scope, and the changing roles of flows. In analysing the potential benefits of EB to global sourcing, the enhancement on SC components and alignment effects are discussed. Finally, a framework is proposed to highlight how EB and global sourcing interact with each other, resulting in five major issues: the enhancement of SC components, the changing micro-environment, the effect of accelerating evolution of global sourcing, the integration of activities, and the significant improvement on outcomes.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This study analyses choices made by subjects who were asked to accept or reject each of 20 clauses of a web-based software-purchasing contract, of which six clauses were deceitful. The subjects were split into two media conditions. In the text condition, the clauses were presented as text in a web browser window. In the video condition, web browser-embedded video clips were used. No significant differences were found across media conditions. Surprisingly though, the subjects did 18% and 14% worse than chance in terms of rejecting deceitful clauses through the text and video conditions, respectively.</abstract>

<title>Selecting forecasting model parameters in Material Requirement Planning systems.</title>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper investigates how the choice of parameters for forecasting models influences the performance of MRP systems. The results of the study show that the error measures, which are used to estimate forecasting parameters, have a significant effect on the system performance. Minimising Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and Mean Square Error (MSE) in choosing the forecasting model parameters will result in total cost that is much closer to the minimum cost than minimising the mean error (Bias). While operating parameters such as Freezing Proportion (FP) and Cost Structure (CS) do significantly influence the relationship between total cost and the error measures that are used to estimate forecasting model parameters, both MAD and MSE are better than Bias under all conditions. The use of Safety Stock (SS) does not influence the conclusion.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: We report computer simulation experiments to model the dilemma of using cars or mass transportation in large cities. The individual Pavlovian agents may cooperate with each other for the collective interest (public transportation) or may defect, i.e., pursue their selfish interests by driving their cars. Their decisions to cooperate or defect accumulate over time to produce a resulting collective order that determines the success or failure of the transportation system. The results show that it is quite possible to achieve a situation when the enormous majority of people prefer using mass transportation to driving cars.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Information and communication technologies are crucial for intermediaries in electronic business. In order to compete with strong competition in internet-based markets, differentiation from competitors is required. This means that innovative service ideas need to be implemented in order to succeed. The approach discussed here is helpful in reducing the complexity of matching service ideas with the most suitable information and communication technologies. This paper explains the methodology and describes the insights gained during its practical application for selecting wireless technologies for intermediary logistic services.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: To a modern enterprise, it is important to be aware of the development/change of personnel qualification requirements so that its human resource management policy and plan can keep up with the change. Advantages of electronic recruiting on the web have attracted more and more employers. Job advertising web pages reflect changing knowledge and experience of personnel qualification requirements from the practice of different companies. It is possible, to some extent, to find the necessary information from these web pages by automated information processing. In this paper, we demonstrate how to use the web mining method to discover the latest information about an occupation. In a case study, job advertising websites including Yahoo! Careers (HotJobs) and FlipDog are investigated to find US delivery driver qualification requirements. The results are compared with those of another survey for German drivers by studying traditional paper-based job advertisements.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: There has been a rapidly growing interest in electronic business (e-bus), although most of the issues surrounding e-business have been descriptive. Within supply chains, the integration process has often been mentioned without clearly indicating how this process can be implemented gradually and what this integration really requires. This study empirically tested a taxonomy that illustrated a firm's strategic positioning along two axes: Electronic Business and Integrated Supply Chain Management (ISCM). A firm's position in this taxonomy represents its Electronic Supply Chain Orientation (ESCO). The results from the Australian manufacturing industry indicated that there appeared to be four general strategic options that firms adopted: laggers, e-bus players, ISCM players, and integrators. The ISCM players tended to have the networking and joint efficiency operation in place, which reflected the ISCM capability of the ESCO; the e-bus players demonstrated the integrated applications and business to business (B2B) applications dimensions that illustrated the e-business capability in the ESCO model. The integrators had the most significant e-business and ISCM capabilities, which were joint efforts in the ESCO model. The laggers were those stuck in the middle without significant or developing capabilities in any of these dimensions of the ESCO. Supply chain performance measures also indicated that the integrators gained most significant benefits while the laggers were well behind.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The call centre has become the main communication channel between the cell phone users and mobile communication operator. By integrating Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), D&M Information System (IS) Success Model, Service Quality and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), this paper proposes an integrated model of the factors, which influence the cell phone users' intention to adopt call centre services. Drawing on the empirical base of 198 users' questionnaires, the paper concludes that users' Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Behavioural Control (PBC) positively influence their intention to adopt the call centre services. Information quality positively related to users' PU, system quality to users' Perceived Ease Of Use (PEOU) and users' self-efficacy has a positive influence on PBC and users' PEOU.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: E-commerce diffusion has had tremendous success stories in large businesses; however, organisational theories that are applicable to large businesses may not necessarily fit with Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the same way. This study identifies major factors at macro and micro levels that hindered SMEs' participation in e-commerce adoption in Asia during the early stages of e-commerce uptake over the period 1999â2001. Although, the study is limited to Asia, and is therefore limited in size and scope, the results could contribute to better understanding of the hindering factors in e-commerce adoption as they relate specifically to the business environment of SMEs.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This research explores bank and corporate customer views on customer satisfaction with interpersonal and internet channels in Thailand, and examines the concept of integration to blend the two channels rather than operating them as separate alternatives. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with top management of five leading commercial banks, which have implemented internet banking, and with financial officers of 14 large corporate customers of these banks. Corporate customers still prefer personal contact most of the time, although they find the internet channel useful for some things. Sources of satisfaction with interpersonal service interactions are broad. Satisfaction drivers on the internet are relatively narrow, but sources of dissatisfaction on the internet are quite extensive. Integrating interpersonal and internet channels more strongly would be a quite attractive new option to suit their businesses. Thai banks, however, do not seem to be aware of customer views favouring integration.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: In recent years, many companies have given customer loyalty a high priority on their list of business needs because customer loyalty is essential to their success. Companies must recognise the loyalty and characteristics (price-driven, service-driven or quality-driven et al.) of their customers and market to them appropriately. In this paper, we put forward a customer loyalty analysis process based on customer repurchase, customer price perception, service perception and quality perception. In the data mining process, we analyse the prior customer loyalty information, mine the potential customer information and predict the customer's future purchase. We give a method to set up a statistical model for transition probability matrix of purchase proportion. According to Bayesian rule, we obtain the conditional probability, and calculate the equation that is referred as the likelihood function, and then design a classifier based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for discovering which customer is loyal and which is not loyal.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper is an attempt to discuss foundational issues for designing e-learning that are sensitive to specific social and cultural settings in developing countries. We argue that recognising cultural diversity is a critical factor in design and use of e-learning as an instrument to promote development in a globalisation perspective. Drawing on contemporary research literature, the paper explores basic notions of culture; models of cultural diversity; cultural considerations in designing and using ICT in e-learning; and models and dimensions of cultural diversity in education and e-learning. We also characterise some common traits in Eastern, particularly Iranian, pedagogical cultures.</abstract>

<title>The global diffusion of internet attack incidents: analysis of a bad innovation.</title>

<journal>International Journal of Internet and Enterprise Management</journal>
<number>4</number>
<abstract>Abstract: Diffusion literature to date has not dealt with bad innovations. This article discusses the nature of global temporal diffusion of internet attack incidents â a bad form of innovation. A number of models are investigated to see which one can best fit the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Centre (CERT/CC) incident data (1988â2001) and explain the rationale behind such attacks. A push-pull model fits the data reasonably well and has better explanatory power than the traditional logistic and exponential models. The parameters of the model can provide measures of both attack imitation and deterrence. The model was subsequently validated with another set of incident data from Federal Computer Incident Response Centre (FedCIRC) and its predictive power was also verified to be reasonable. The implication of this study is that security measures are inadequate as compared to the volume of attack incidents and that serious attention needs to be paid to increase security measures of US firms.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The grounded-theory case study methodology was applied to examine a profitable company in cellular phone New Product Development (NPD). The goal was to participate in focus groups of NPD teams to document how they reverse-engineered competitive designs. The focus group theme analysis was linked to taxonomies applied by similar empirical case studies in the literature. A brain storming technique was used with the case study focus group to capture and contrast the ideation processes with knowledge creation and educational psychology theories. Several models were created to externalise the NPD team design processes.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Since the early 1990s, business process reengineering (BPR) has become a buzzword around the world. Of the BPR methods and models suggested, the majority have put much attention on redesigning processes to improve the defined process performance. Those that stress the importance of strategic process reengineering focus more on the idea that redesigning should be embarked upon and implemented on a broader scope (cross- functional) in order to obtain greater pay offs, whereas the impact of BPR on strategies is paid less attention. In this paper, we propose a broader application of BPR to the enterprise and, consequently, stress the importance of BPR with respect to strategies and the role of strategic directions in light of BPR. Thus, we develop a conceptual BPR model that links a firm's long-term strategy, with a real-world example.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Despite the positive effects achieved with Information Technology (IT) use in the healthcare sector, IT solutions do not always increase efficiency or prevent medical errors, and the poor quality of data available is often seen as one of the reasons. The purpose of this paper is to determine the characteristics that ensure the quality of data. More specifically, the paper focuses on the non-technical characteristics that patient-specific medication information should have, and its current situation within a Finnish primary care organisation. To ensure that the development of smooth patient service chains will proceed consensually with data users, and that all the issues related to clinical work are considered, an assessment of the current process of medication information management is required. Though the case organisation uses Electronic Health Record (EHR), often the most important source of information was found to be the patient. It was found that sources of medication data do not always meet the needs of the healthcare professionals. Furthermore, the characteristics of what constitute quality data could not always be found, which has left professionals using their knowledge to fill information gaps.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Case studies are used to examine and classify e-business adoption amongst wineries located in the Australian state of Victoria. Two atomic e-business models are identified â Direct-to-Customer and Intermediary â as the only types amongst six cases studied. Ancillary to examining the e-business characteristics of these wineries, the study of internet adoption also allowed a knowledge-based dimension of the wineries to be examined. The wineries are viewed as the wine industry's dominant cluster entity and are found to combine traditional and electronic activities in emergent e-business models that exhibit key characteristics of knowledge-based enterprises.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: We have developed a new approach to supporting business decisions that can be used to evaluate the risks inherent in the competitive environment. We have shown that the results of business risk analysis can be used for building a game theory model. By using risk analysis and game theory together, we were able to take into account the expected behaviour of the competitors and the interrelations among them. We present a case study in the Hungarian telecommunications sector to show how the result of the risk analysis of the net cost of a given product can be built into a game theory model.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Nowadays, almost all enterprises are supported by Information Systems (ISs). For a group of systems (ISs) to interoperate, the organisations responsible for the systems must first agree on what the words mean in the interoperation. This agreement is called an ontology, a description of the world shared by the participants. This paper presents a set of high-level concepts (upper ontology) for interoperating ISs taking into account not only the ontology of information objects but also the ontology of messages and the actions performed by the interoperating systems. It integrates an existing formal ontology for information objects with an upper ontology for messages and actions based on speech act theory, represented in a uniform way using UML profiles.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: With Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs), companies are facing a paradigm shift towards services as the key unit of their enterprise architectures. An exploitation of the potential of SOA is up to the applicability of business models for a transformation into service compositions. However, several shortcomings prevent semi-formal models from being a suitable resource of an automated transformation process. Problems result from a multitude of modelling aims, objects and procedures. This paper provides a method for business-process-oriented SOA design. A modelling environment gives an overview of business requirements and allows appropriate assignment of services to the business functions at the same time.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate and enhance the applicability of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to the explanation of the intended continuance level of telecommuting. The results of a survey of 101 current telecommuters provide strong support for the proposed theoretical developments. Overall, the model explains 49.2% of the variance in telecommuters' intended level of telecommuting continuance. Despite a negative moderating effect of habit, attitude maintains a significant effect on intention. Subjective norms also continue to exert a moderate effect on intention.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: While collaborative community is applied comprehensively in school learning and organisational training, research on collaborative learning process is emerging. Traditional statistical methods make it difficult to perform large volume in-depth analysis on interaction regulations and mechanisms in collaborative communities, especially when bottom-up analysis is required. In this study, data-mining methodology is addressed to discover knowledge from large-scale and real interaction data in collaborative learning communities. We propose to use Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) approach for knowledge discovery in collaborative communities. A case study of role discovery in collaborative learning is developed to demonstrate the usefulness of the approach.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The excessive use of the internet for non-work-related activities is a form of white-collar deviant behaviour at work. Applying the Theory of Reasoned Action, structural equation modelling was used to predict Cyber-Production (CP) deviant behaviours in the workplace. Attitude and intention to visit non-work-related websites were found to be important predictors of such behaviours. Workplace Subjective Norms (SN) had no impact on the tendency to perform CP deviant activities but did influence intention to visit work-related websites. The findings of the study contributed to an expanded understanding of the potential predictors of CP deviance in the workplace and suggested appropriate strategies for effective internet management.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The successful construction businesses of the next decade will be the ones that use digital tools to reinvent the way they work. A new way of doing business would entail using fast, accurate information to plan operations and processes, delivering dissimilar features to those delivered by competitors, enhancing client service, empowering employees and reacting instantaneously to changes in the marketplace. Now construction companies are under pressure to find ways of enhancing effectiveness and quality, of increasing speed of project delivery whilst simultaneously reducing costs and prices. The construction industry can learn from the successes of manufacturing and service industries. To illustrate the point, this paper draws on examples of success stories, which have applied the enterprise resource planning (ERP) supply chain management (SCM) solutions. The potential for ERP in integrating the supply chain across customer/supplier interfaces to create a win-win scenario in the UK construction industry is discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Nowadays, service delivery is strongly linked to the use of new technologies and of the internet channel. However, there are also countless websites misconceived and without any concern about customers' expectations. The companies should identify which requirements are really important for customers and conceive the service provided by the websites according to the 'voice of the customer'. In this piece of research, a methodology based on several Quality tools, namely the Kano's questionnaire and the HOQ, is proposed to develop websites based on customers' needs and expectations. An empirical study was developed within the framework of online travel agencies. The study was based on a combined sample of real customers of online travel agencies with individuals participating in advanced courses of web design.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper aims at comparing patterns of digital divide on the global scale. The question of whether the global trend of digital divide has widened or narrowed is discussed in this study. Moreover, this paper examines effects of geographical region, developmental level, social inequality, and global linkage of economy on the penetration of Internet usage. Data is collected and compared from sources of the World Bank and ITU. The results suggest the global digital divide has persisted. A dual development has been found in an overtime comparison. Developed and rapidly developing regions have shown a narrowing gap of Internet penetration toward the Northern European region in the past few years. The other developing and the least developed regions, in contrast, have verified the stratified model and revealed persisting divides over time compared to the developed regions. An overall high digital Gini coefficient worldwide indicates global inequality of Internet penetration is phenomenal.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Digital piracy is threatening the global multimedia content industry and blindly applied coercive Digital Right Management (DRM) policies do nothing but legitimise this piracy. This paper presents new software and hardware infrastructure aimed at reconciling the content providers' and consumers' points of view by giving the ability to develop fair business models (i.e., that preserve the interest of both parties). The solution is based on the use of tamper-resistant devices (smart cards) to securely store sensitive data (e.g., personal consumer data or data expressing the terms of a B2C contract or licence) and to perform the computation required by a contract/licence activation. In other words, smart cards can be seen as tamper-resistant Service Level Agreement (SLA) enablers.</abstract>

<title>Supporting the design of service contracts with interaction models.</title>

<abstract>Abstract: A service contract typically specifies the service level, i.e., the quality parameters of the service to be performed. In addition to this static part, there is also the need to specify the business interactions required to achieve the service level, which can be seen as the dynamic part of the contract. We suggest a procedure to derive both parts of the service contract from the same model of the interactions between service provider and client. This ensures the alignment of both parts and adds richer, behavioural semantics to the contract. We show the feasibility of the approach in a case study with a logistics service provider and its clients.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Built upon the process theory and the view of dynamic capabilities, this study defines two types of supply chain dynamic capabilities – supply chain integration capability and supply chain cooperation capability. The study also proposes that these supply chain dynamic capabilities play a significant role in determining the performance of Inter-Organisational Systems (IOS). A general survey has been conducted in the personal computer industry in Taiwan to validate the research model. The results show that supply chain integration capability has a greater moderating effect on the performance of IOS than supply chain cooperation capability.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Access to timely, complete and relevant knowledge is a key competitive differentiator in the present economic environment. But most knowledge management (KM) today only moves the traditional, expert-based KM processes onto electronic media. This paper discusses a paradigm shift from an expert-centric to a Peer-to-Peer approach to knowledge creation and management. Leveraging the lowered transaction costs of internet technology, early movers in the KM space are piloting methods of collaboration that have been invented, practiced and refined by the open source and free software community over the last two decades. This new approach, based on open collaboration, has the potential to revolutionise the way knowledge is created, shared and managed. We outline characteristics of the two opposing paradigms and discuss ways in which the Peer-to-Peer knowledge management approach is being applied today. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and managerial implications of introducing the new paradigm within organisations.</abstract>

The notion of a Value Catalyst where a firm's Demand Chain processes and Supply Chain process fuse to create Value Outcomes is explored. This analysis is applied to a group of wagering operators in Australia, illustrating how e-commerce technologies have significantly enhanced the Demand Chains of those operators with the resulting Value Catalyst contributing to creation of new Value in those businesses.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper investigates the performance changes of 390 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China during 2000-2008 with the existence of share issue privatisation (SIP), and analyses the macro and micro determinants of these changes. We find that SIP significantly improves SOEs' output and efficiency, and the performance changes vary along with different macro and micro factors. Economic growth, industry regulations, regional marketisation, institutional investors, and equity refinancing are positively related to performance changes. However, capital market development, control of large shareholders, contest of shareholders, and capital occupation exhibit significant negative impacts on firms#39; performance changes.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The potential advantages of forming virtual teams are well known although many barriers exist which obstruct their realisation. The uniqueness of virtual teamwork is in its potential to integrate different bodies of knowledge into a new synergy. The paper argues that unravelling the mystery of knowledge creation processes in virtual partnerships requires an in-depth understanding of the complex interaction processes involved in forming computer-mediated business relationships. The focus, therefore, is on the process of collective ''knowing'', defined as a team's actions and interactions embedded in unique social activities in virtual teams rather than on knowledge being a pre-given resource possessed by the team members. The paper presents the preliminary results of a qualitative research study on seven virtual partnerships and proposes an initial conceptual framework of the knowledge creative processes taking place in virtual business relationships.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: As China embarks on the journey of transforming itself from an isolated state-controlled central planning economy into a market-oriented world economic power house, information technology (IT) will increasingly play an important role. The knowledge and experiences accumulated in academic research on and managerial practices in IT in the developed countries over the last three decades can benefit tremendously such a transformation. How can IT be used to create business value in Chinese enterprises as IT begins to permeate all aspects of business operations? Is the 'IT doesn't matter' debate in the USA and developed countries relevant in China? How can China benefit from the successes of IT practices experienced in the developed economies while avoiding the pitfalls? What are the challenges? In this study, we examine different views of IT business value and provide recommendations regarding IT applications in China based on its unique set of cultural, economic and political characteristics. We discuss some lessons and implications for Chinese companies about how to best use the power of IT to create business value.</abstract>

This study attempts to examine the major variables that affect the initiation, adoption, and implementation of DRP by Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) to secure their Health Management Information System (HMIS) environments. Different sets of factors from among HMO risk-taking behaviour, HMIS reliance, structural variables, environmental factors, and DRP characteristics were found to be significantly related to the initiation, adoption, and implementation stages of the DRP process.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: There appears to be a current trend for companies to invest in business intelligence (BI) systems to improve analytical capabilities to support decision making. Although much attention has been paid to decision-making benefits of BI adoption, limited research has examined factors that influence user acceptance of BI systems. Therefore, this study utilises the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to investigate the determinants of users' behavioural intention to use BI systems, and the moderating effects of gender, age, experience and voluntariness of use on the relationships between the determinants and behavioural intention/usage behaviour. Data was collected from 330 firms in Taiwan's electronics industry. This result shows that performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and computer anxiety were significant determinants of users' behavioural intention to use BI systems, while effort expectancy was not. Facilitating conditions and behavioural intention were significant predictors of users' usage behaviour of BI systems.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper considers the mediating effects of user participation activities that interact with crucial skills to explain the varying degrees of software success. Questionnaires were mailed to randomly selected Information System Special Interest Group (ISSIG) members of the Project Management Institute (PMI) in the USA. A total of 171 questionnaires were returned. The overall results of the analysis show that user hands-on activities lower the risks of certain skill deficiencies during the duration of the project to improve the successful implementation of software projects, while user partnering serves as a mediator between application expertise, general expertise, and software success.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Business intelligence (BI) has become an integral part of e-business activities of companies. The success of such effort is dependent on integration and management of terabytes of transactional data in a large-scale data warehouse to support various analyses. In the last two years, web-oriented BI and outsourcing have led to more challenging problems of integrating these new types of data with the internal transactional data. Furthermore, recent trends in enabling the real-time company have placed new performance demands on BI software. Significant research has been carried out in optimising multidimensional aggregation in data warehousing that serves as the base data for BI analysis software. However, virtually all of this work has focused on either simple aggregates or on specialised analysis such as in human genome and other scientific applications. In this paper, we focus on statistical analysis models and techniques to reduce the volume of base data and enable real-time BI analysis. We introduce a new data aggregation model, referred to as the multivariate and multidimensional aggregated data model (MÂ²AD), for supporting statistical computing in a data warehouse environment.</abstract>

Since the beginning of IST in 1999, some 450 projects have been launched in the area of new methods of work and electronic commerce with a funding budget of half a billion euros. The R&D activities were accompanied by policy initiatives such as eEurope and the European Research Area that were launched at the beginning of the new millennium. The paper shows that technology development efforts underpin the policy initiatives and both together offer a coherent approach towards an online Europe.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Employees continue to report multifarious e-mail concerns ('e-mail defects') including ambiguous unclear messages, e-mail overload, security and privacy issues, and e-mail interruptions. These defects have an effect on employee efficiency and effectiveness. This paper explores the importance of identifying e-mail defects and the effectiveness of training employees in efficient use of e-mail at four UK organisations, using Seminar-Based Training (SBT) and Computer-Based Training (CBT) delivery modes. The findings suggest that SBT has a diminishing impact over a very short period of time, but a combined approach of SBT and CBT is more effective and provides better results.</abstract>

<title>A modular subroutine selection process in disaster management based on a needs classification scheme.</title>

<journal>International Journal of Internet and Enterprise Management</journal>

<abstract>Abstract: A broader view of our approach is to provide the flexibility to organise and adapt a tailored Decision Support System (DSS) model (or existing modular subroutines) according to the dynamic needs of a disaster. For this purpose, the existing modular subroutines of DSS models are selected and integrated to produce a dynamic integrated model focused on a given disaster scenario. In order to facilitate the effective integration of these subroutines, it is necessary to select the appropriate modular subroutine beforehand. Therefore, subroutine selection is an important preliminary step towards model integration in developing Disaster Management Decision Support Systems (DMDSS). The ability to identify a modular subroutine for a problem is an important feature before performing model integration. Therefore, our focus in this paper is on developing a methodology to help identify subroutines from existing DSS models developed for disaster management.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper extends the definition and role of Enterprise Modelling (EM) and describes recent research results that have led to the definition of the next generation of enterprise modelling â Enterprise Visual Scenes (EVS). The focus is on the transition from EM to EVS and what the implications will be for industry, developers of solutions, system providers, future users and user communities. Based on identified industrial challenges and the current state of the art and state of practice within enterprise modelling, the properties and benefits of enterprise visual scenes are outlined. Examples of early practical experiences from the use of the approach are provided, pointing to the work ahead for fulfilling the EVS vision.</abstract>

<title>Process integration based on multiple workflow domains.</title>

<volume>3</volume>
<journal>International Journal of Internet and Enterprise Management</journal>

<abstract>Abstract: The process integration puts business modelling and application system design together to optimise the business process management. In this paper, a new process integration scheme based on multiple workflow domains through process decomposition and multiple domain management is proposed for intra-organisation oriented process management. By decomposing a long-life business process into several shorter processes, the coupling relationship inside the process can be reduced, and therefore management flexibility is accordingly enhanced. Because each workflow domain is an autonomous entity, management strategies or policies can be specifically proposed and applied to different domains rather than the whole organisation, for the improvement of business efficiency, cost and quality.</abstract>

<title>COSMOS: A discrete-event modeling methodology for construction process.</title>

<journal>International Journal of Internet and Enterprise Management</journal>
<number>2</number>
<url>db/journals/ijiem/ijiem1.html#Damrianant03</url>
<abstract>Abstract: Process modelling and simulation can be regarded as a framework within which discrete-event systems such as construction operations can be analysed, designed and improved. This paper proposes an alternative modelling methodology called COSMOS (construction oriented simulation modelling system). The approach is designed for the modelling of discrete-event processes for the purpose of simulation and is geared towards construction process orientation. While the basic COSMOS constructs are based on the basic formalism of Petri Nets, substantial extensions are made to the common Petri Net approach. COSMOS graphical network models are built by connecting appropriate nodes with appropriate arcs and assigning tokens to their places in a way that portrays the characteristics and logic of actual systems. If necessary, attributes and control statements can be attached to suitable modelling elements to enhance the capability of the models. The models are then capable of representing systems that are more complicated. COSMOS provides a means of reflecting reality and practicality in construction-process modelling.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The study considers how collaborative activities and joint decision making impact information technology implementation and the firm's market performance in the supply chain. We have provided three major findings upon analysis of data from 133 companies: (1) identified the importance of leveraging information technology implementation through staff training; (2) recognised the effect of collaboration in the supply chain and (3) illustrated the association of collaborative activities, decision making and production improvement with the supply chain market performance. The result of the study indicates that assisted with advanced information technology, successful collaboration among supply chain echelons does positively affect a firm's market performance if effective communication in the process of decision making is fostered.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: In recent years, fast growth in the development and application of e-business technologies has generated vast interest among practising managers and management scholars in inventory database management. E-business technologies enable an inventory manager to make coordinated decisions on the basis of regularly updated and timely ordered information. The dynamic features of the inventory items and inventory locations make a rationally organised time schedule of regular and irregular updates for inventory databases difficult. Using a game theory strategy of optimal regular updates for dynamic databases can significantly lower costs associated with the database update process. This article describes an internet-based solution of creation, maintenance, update, and query of a computerised inventory database for inventory items and their locations with time-dependent (dynamic) and time-independent (static) attributes. Further research opportunities in inventory database management using e-business applications are discussed.</abstract>

<title>A study into the creation of feral information systems as a response to an ERP implementation within the supply chain of a large government-owned corporation.</title>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper investigates the creation of feral systems as a response to an Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) systems implementation of Systems, Applications and Products (SAP) in the supply chain of a large Government-Owned Corporation (GOC). Using a case study approach and extensive interviews, the researchers found that a SAP system was rigid, highly structured and ignored by some elements of the social system. Moreover, it focused on technical prowess of the SAP solution at the apparent expense of supporting real-world activity. Such a focus allowed the spontaneous creation of 'feral systems' that involved ad hoc processes used to get around the SAP solution, to complete important work. This paper begins with an analysis of the feral systems concept and then examines the case study of feral systems in the organisation in question. This paper concludes with a call for future research into feral systems and their effectiveness on ERP systems to support real-world activity.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Business-to-Business (B2B) electronic commerce technologies are becoming increasingly important for South African (SA) apparel producers as they are integrated into global value chains and exposed to the demands of more sophisticated markets. For the SA apparel sector, B2B e-commerce represents an opportunity not only to connect with global markets but also to catch up and remain at the frontier of ''world class'' competitiveness. Despite strong theoretical arguments suggesting that B2B e-commerce has much to offer the SA apparel industry, the empirical evidence emanating from a survey of the apparel manufacturing and retail sectors would seem to suggest that e-commerce is still in its infancy. However, there is potential for growth. The paper suggests a raft of policy measures designed to create an enabling and nurturing environment aimed at promoting and accelerating the diffusion of B2B e-commerce technologies in the SA apparel sector.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The Personal Systems Group, a division within IBM, successfully implemented SAP's R/3 enterprise information system in its largest manufacturing facility in North Carolina. The project, at the time the second largest SAP implementation in the world with respect to the number of users, was completed on-time and on-budget. This paper presents an inside look at this large-scale systems implementation: its motivation, the project structure, the complexity of project tasks, the project personnel and the project outcomes. The paper presents six factors that led IBM to a successful implementation: 1. top management commitment; 2. strong project management; 3. team member skills; 4. team member motivation and dedication; 5. effective communication with users; 6. an effectively planned and implemented change management strategy. Evidence of how these factors enabled the Personal Systems Group to successfully achieve the longer-term vision of streamlining their supply chain to increase productivity, cost savings, and customer satisfaction are also presented.</abstract>

<title>Digital opportunity: the digital gap between openness and closeness of relational divide upon the mobile phone usage.</title>
<pages>269-292</pages>
<year>2006</year>
<volume>4</volume>
<journal>International Journal of Internet and Enterprise Management</journal>
<number>3</number>
<abstract>Abstract: The possibility of communication nowadays depends fully on the usage of modern technology. Several digital divides exist with respect to Mobile Phone (MP) usage, and they further aggravate the interpersonal relationship. In personal connection, the availability of MP users can be measured by several indicators, such as phone number sharing behaviour and phone answering strategies. The MP users also look over the necessity of using their MP to communicate with others in daily life. The 'dual availability' model distinguishes active/passive attitude and behaviour of individual's calling and receiving styles. In the relational connection, the usage of MP, which shows multiple dimensions, such as phone contacts, face-to-face contacts and spatial distance effects, implies the openness and closeness of interpersonal relationships. In our research, MP use is a proxy of human behaviour as well as relationships, and it represents a digital opportunity for users to improve their relationship. With regard to the personal connections, caller effects show overwhelming domination over either the media use or relationship change, while the receiver effects show weaker influence. Unilateral relationships and network relationships are respectively influenced by personal and relational connections and consequently demonstrate different appearances.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Based on empirical data, this study analyses the influence of online information on OTAs' website on hotel room sales, and the difference among four types of hotel in China hospitality industry. According to the origins, the information on online travel agencies' website can be classified into three types which influence hotel e-bookings differently. Online reviews and attribute information both influence most of hotel e-bookings significantly except for the variables of cleanliness rating and room rate. Recommended information provided by online travel agencies also has a positive impact on hotel e-bookings except for the variable of browsing index. In terms of the types of hotel, clear differences are also found in the research. The empirical results reveal that online reviews significantly influence the hotel e-bookings except for luxury hotels. But the attribute information of hotels has significant influence on the online bookings of luxury hotels, while room rate has no significant impact on top grade hotels, comfortable hotels and budget hotels. Additionally, the recommended information significantly influences the hotel e-bookings of top grade hotels especially. Furthermore, some managerial implications for online travel agencies and hoteliers are discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: These last years, many researchers have focused on e-commerce, particularly on the market architecture and on the negotiation protocols. This paper tries to propose a taboo search-based approach to solve the bid evaluation problem in e-commerce. The proposed approach considers the cost, risk, and temporal constraints to evaluate complex bids of suppliers. It is performed by an intelligent agent using taboo search concepts to select the optimal set of bids for coordinated tasks. A clients/server model for e-commerce integrating the taboo search agent is discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper aims to investigate whether the boards curb earnings management by revising the compensation contract with CEOs. Using a sample of CEO compensation from 1993 to 2009, we find that the boards decrease cash payment sensitivity to accruals in the presence of the horizon problem. However, in the mean time, the boards heighten equity payment sensitivity to accruals and keep the total pay for performance sensitivity unchanged. We argue this temporary equity rewards for discretionary accruals will disappear as the value of equity claims will be realised over time and any market overpricing will evaporate by then. Overall, our results suggest that the boards can curb earnings management by revising pay-for-performance sensitivity in the terminal year.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This editorial introduction to the special issue entitled ''Organising knowledge'' tries to prepare the movements from ''knowledge management'' to ''organising knowledge'' that characterise the call for papers to this issue. The need to include reflections on how knowledge organises while we try to organise knowledge is emphasised. Such a need is fuelled by an historical and philosophical reflection on management as a form of knowledge and practice. The concepts of ''tecknowlogy'' and ''socioledge'' are introduced to suggest that management often reduces knowledge (via information technology) into tecknowlogy, whereas we need reflexive and creative organisation of knowledge, affirming its processual and social/relational character if we seek learning and innovation as part of organisational creativity.</abstract>

Our approach does not involve any linguistic resources and can be easily implemented within any information awareness system. When tested on standard test collections, the performance of our approach was found to be comparable with that of the current top-of-the-line, complex and expensive linguistic approaches, and significantly better than that of other completely trainable approaches. We also present the design of our ongoing empirical study and the qualitative observations from our pilot experiments.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Past research suggests that explicit inputs, such as reading techniques documents, are the critical factors influencing software review performance. However, there is no published evidence investigating the important relationship between explicit inputs and performance in practice. As a result, the aim of this paper is to examine the effect of explicit inputs on software review performance in practice. A total of 205 developers voluntarily participated in a questionnaire survey in Australia in 2003. The main findings include: (1) previously reviewed software documents are the key drivers to the performance, (2) reading technique documents, prescription documents and reports has no value to software review performance.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The building and construction (B&C) industry is a one-off industry that has adopted a traditional and conservative attitude, resisting technical and organisational innovations. Nevertheless, it has been recognised that the lack of interoperability between the actors acting in its production processes is a major problem for the modernisation of this industry. A key factor in solving this problem is the adoption and implementation of standard models towards a global integrated environment. However, the implementation of standards has been identified as being costly and requiring a large amount of manpower. In order to stimulate the adoption and implementation of such standards, specific tools must be developed acting at a standard meta-model level. This paper begins describing the major problems that have been identified in the B&C industry in the scope of interoperability of software and applications, proposing a meta-model based environment to assist in solving the integration problem at metadata level. The paper concludes by proposing a methodology to assist in the validation and to assure the reliability of the integrated environment.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Information and inventory are alternate approaches to managing uncertainty and coordination among trading partners. Application of these approaches is carried out through business processes that mediate customer/supplier relationships. These business processes vary on a continuum from tight coordination, e.g. vendor managed inventory, to loose coordination, spot-buy auctions. The value of electronic business is that it lowers the cost of implementing these business processes, and thereby expands the range of choices available to trading partners. Ideally, dyadic trading partner relationship management should be extended to whole-system supply chain coordination. Given business realities, however, supply chain change will be limited to better multiple, one-to-one relationships. A powerful mechanism for improving these relationships is the ability to inform local choice with knowledge about system-wide behaviour. To achieve this improvement, collective action is needed to develop standards in support of data interoperability. This work was done under Contract #50SBN7C1249, awarded to the Research Triangle Institute by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The use of the web to support and enhance business operations and services has grown at an accelerating pace in the last decade, as manifested by firms' increasing embrace of various web-enabled business models and strategies. Conceivably, an individual's information search or retrieval effectiveness or efficiency greatly depends on the organisation of the contents accessible at a site; e.g., web pages. The 'quality' of website design has not yet received due attention from prior research, particularly quality design and assessment at the website level. An integrated approach is proposed to (1) design a conceptual network for modelling the structure of a website, (2) develop accessibility models for website design assessment and (3) enhance the design quality of a website on an evolutionary basis. The approach takes into consideration individuals' dynamic browsing/navigation behaviours and integrates website design, evaluation and improvement to support continual and adaptive enhancements.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: In this paper, using structural equation modelling, significance of relationships between the affecting factors and knowledge-sharing behaviour was examined. To test the proposed model of research, an Iranian leading company in the field of ICT was selected. Using the structural model as an output of data analysis, the significant influentive constructs of model were identified. According to the results of data analysis, it was clear that Managerial Factors (MFs) and Personality Traits (PTs) have significant influence on knowledge-sharing behaviour in the organisation.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Construction project management traditionally uses two dimensional visualisation techniques to analyse project performance. In this paper, it is proposed that a more comprehensive performance measurement system might represent project progress as a three-dimensional data surface. A conceptual three-dimensional framework for the representation of non-physical construction industry data is outlined. This framework led to the development of ''Procession'', a three-dimensional information visualisation software tool. Procession uses a three-dimensional data surface as an abstract representation of the described framework. The target group for Procession was social housing project clients. Field experiments were undertaken to compare the information quality and usability of Procession, with the progress reporting methods believed used by construction clients. The most important finding was that clients were significantly more able to assess project status with the developed software, than with their traditional reporting methods.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Despite the recent developments of electronic market places, SMEs still need an affordable, integrated set of web tools to take advantage of the new ways of doing business in the e-commerce environment. This paper has the intention to show how added value can be provided to SMEs who offer extended products to their customers by extending their present e-commerce business models. The idea will be based on the European IST project SMARTISAN (Smart Artisan), which is developing a generic XML-based e-business solution, in which the developed services are piloted in several test situations including various SMEs from different sectors. In general, the project intends to contribute to the evolution of digital business trends for SMEs, micro-companies and individual professionals, with the aim of providing a framework for electronic commerce implementation, as well as a roadmap to guide SMEs to understanding and selecting the methodologies, tools and architecture required to implement a successful digital business strategy. However, this paper will not primarily deal with the generic e-commerce solution itself, moreover, we will focus on the innovative business concept which evolves from the idea of extended products, enriching customer services, whilst enhancing Multi-Mode Commerce within the SMEs' business environments.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Information security and privacy in the healthcare sector is an issue of growing importance. The adoption of digital patient records, increased regulation, provider consolidation and the increasing need for information exchange between patients, providers and payers, all point towards the need for better information security. We critically survey the literature on information security and privacy in healthcare, published in information systems journals as well as many other related disciplines including health informatics, public health, law, medicine, the trade press and industry reports. In this paper, we provide a holistic view of the recent research and suggest new areas of interest to the information systems community.</abstract>

<title>Impact of ICT on government innovation policy: an international comparison.</title>

<abstract>Abstract: With the rapid development of information and communications technologies (ICT), the greatest challenge to policy makers today is whether it will have a fundamental and structural impact on the way economies function and its sustainability on people's standard of living. Statistics showed that the ''Solow's productivity paradox'', which saw how productivity growth in major industrialised countries declined in the 1970s and 1980s despite phenomenal growth in technological improvements, has been overthrown by bursting rates of productivity growth since the mid-1990s. Besides establishing evidence of a growth trend, studies also conclude that potential productivity gains from the use of ICT will come from a combination of organisational changes that ICT brings about, a skilled workforce in ICT, and technology R&D spending. Therefore, although productivity gains will extend into the future, the rate at which these gains can be fully realised depends on the speed at which businesses and citizens can embrace ICT. There is clearly a role for the government in the digital economy, not of an economic regulator as under the traditional S&T policy of ''picking the winners'', but more of a facilitator, enabler, and orchestrator of innovative activities. Public policy in the information society needs to focus not only on preventing the digital divide, but more importantly on stimulating the demand for ICT and encouraging technological innovative activities on a broad scale. This paper looks at three aspects of the innovation policy, namely: innovation in the public sector: e-Government; innovation policy in the private sector: fostering technological innovation; innovation policy in the people sector: building an all-inclusive information society. Recognising that the government has the largest client base and that the public sector can serve as a leveraging platform to demonstrate how ICT can meet needs more efficiently, the development of an e-government can provide a catalytic force by stimulating a demand for ICT and creating a ''market'' for ICT applications. From the ''best practices'' of leading e-governments such as Canada, Singapore, the USA, Norway, Australia, and Ireland, four important aspects of an e-government strategy are identified, namely: the development of a broad e-government vision and the implementation of delivery mechanisms; the progression from mainly one-way and passive informational services to providing interactive, citizen-centric, and integrated online services; building transactional capabilities through Public Key Infrastructure, focusing on the authentication, non-repudiation, confidentiality, and integrity of information flows; and equipping civil servants to become knowledge workers in the knowledge economy. In the private sector, critical ''pulse points'' that will encourage technological innovation on a broad scale are identified, namely developing a financial and technical infrastructure, institutionalising a regulatory framework, developing a skilled workforce in ICT, creating an innovative, creative, and entrepreneurial culture, and forming strategic international alliances, illustrated with ''best practices'' from Singapore, the USA, Israel, Finland, Sweden, and Japan. Finally, recognising that the digital divide can be an unfortunate consequence of the ICT revolution, the paper examines what countries such as the USA, Singapore, Sweden, and Finland have done to create an all-inclusive information society, firstly by transforming non-ICT users to passive ICT-users through increasing their ability to access information, and finally to active ICT-users, where ICT becomes a means of communication and a way of life. Specific regulatory issues thrown up by the information society, such as the delicate balance between privacy protection and the risks of abuse by specific interest groups, will also be examined.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This study explored a unique approach to motivating online students in an introductory IT course. The authors conducted and videotaped surprise interviews with former business graduates and offered the recorded interviews to online business students enrolled in an introductory IT course. The authors then compared the academic performances of the students who watched the surprise interviews and those who did not. The study employed a mixed research methodology and found that students who watched the surprise interviews achieved significantly better performance than students who did not in all aspects of learning outcome assessment.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The notion of the digital divide encompasses many different dimensions. As a matter of fact, more than digital divide, we should talk about digital divides. Access to ICTs and usage are the two variables that determine the width of the divide. The adequate consideration of these two factors is, thus, necessary in any public programme focusing on fighting against the digital divide. The purpose of this article is to move forward in the understanding of what the digital divide implies according to the level of development of the different countries and, from that point, to analyse the challenges they must face and the different paths they can take to go beyond them.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: With the impact of the e-business enabled supply chain on manufacturers and other members being deeply well understood and exploited, new supply chain strategies, such as vendor-managed inventory, collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment, and efficient consumer response, have begun to exploit these new communication channels. This paper is aimed at establishing e-business-enabled supply chain procedure models and simulation research for quantifying the impact of information and communication technologies. Simulation results of e-business supply chains illuminate diverse practical effects under different kinds of demand.</abstract>

<title>Managing constrained capacity: a simulation study.</title>

<abstract>Abstract: This research focuses on the use of constrained capacity availability as a managerial decision variable in production systems. A simulation model was used to evaluate production system performance at various levels of constrained capacity before additional incremental levels of capacity were added. The results indicate that as levels of available capacity approach planned demand levels, or as demand approach capacity levels, the system performance declines. This deterioration of system performance begins at some capacity level higher than average production requirements. That is, at 100% planned capacity utilisation, system performance is considerably degraded, suggesting the need for local managerial manipulation of short-term available capacity levels. In addition, this paper reviews several issues related to constrained capacity and bottleneck management that need clarification.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper presents several experiences and conclusions about the usage of the J2EE middleware platform in an e-commerce mediation framework, and introduces mobile agent possibilities within the same environment. The main conclusions are taken from the Smart-EC project, where J2EE and mobility are considered as a value added in its architecture. Other advanced technologies such as XML based multi-device publishing and the utilisation of e-commerce ontologies to handle static and dynamic aspects of complex services or to control their transactional properties, are also considered in the project.</abstract>

<title>Product configuration system based on the rule base.</title>

<volume>3</volume>
<journal>International Journal of Internet and Enterprise Management</journal>

<abstract>Abstract: From the viewpoint of configuration principle, this study introduces the concept of rule base and adopts the Java 2 platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) framework to implement the structure of configuration system. Based on this structure, the configuration rule base is established, in which all configuration rules are encapsulated. Moreover, graphical rule definition interfaces are designed. As a result, this new structure avoids defining or compiling many 'if-then' sentences that are necessary in the traditional rules-based configuration system, which benefits the maintenance and management of the configuration system. By adopting this new structure of configuration system, this study develops a prototype on the web for the customisation configuration of electric cookers. Application of this system shows that configuration system, based on the rule base, could be maintained and managed easily and run with more efficiency.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: In our analysis of e-political participation among a 2003-random sample survey of 478 respondents drawn from Iowa, Pennsylvania and Colorado, six blocks of variables were entered: (1) socio-demographic (2) place effects, (3) voting, (4) technology use (VCR, cell phone, etc.) and computer apathy, (5) attitudes toward technology and (6) specific uses of the internet. In the final block, younger and White respondents are more apt to be e-citizens. Computer training apathy decreases, and IT advantages increase, support for e-citizenry. Seeking medical e-information and making e-purchases increases engagement in e-politics. No main effects of place are found. For Colorado and Iowa residents, less-engaged voters reported less online political engagement, while those who are more likely to vote are also more likely to be advocates of e-politics. The final model explains 56% of the variation in e-government participation.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The application and performance of Internet Commerce (IC) strategy has become a critical success factor in an industry characterised by volatile change and transformational upheaval. This article presents research examining how IC has been applied in Australian electricity utilities from a retail perspective. The industry's transformation from government regulation to full retail contestability means that retailers need to reassess the way they position themselves in the market and determine how best to interact with their environment. The article reports how Australian electricity retailers have utilised IC to strengthen their relationship with their customers and proactively respond to customer expectations in the provision of more information, greater interactivity and increased access to information in a timely manner and suggests further enhancements.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Fast communication technologies coupled with low-cost storage have aided enormous electronic data gathering. Hence, the need to transform such data to business intelligence and value is strong. In this paper, we focus on analysing e-mail corpuses (Enron) informational exchanges, with the intent to discern hidden organisational structure and cultures. We show that this provides deep insight about employee roles, and organisational structure that is of immense intrinsic value. We predict unknown employee statuses, and identify homogeneous groups and hierarchies amongst them. As a part of this work, we have developed a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) for feature extraction and composition.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The objective of this study is to examine how individual Exchange Ideology (EI) influences the relationship between perceived economic and social benefits and Knowledge Sharing (KS) behaviour in the context of virtual teams. It draws on social exchange theory to test whether EI would positively moderate the relationship between three perceived benefits (i.e., extrinsic rewards, reciprocity, and reputation) and virtual team members' KS behaviour. Contrary to the theory of team-member social exchange, the findings suggest that in virtual KS contexts, EI negatively moderates the relationships between extrinsic rewards, reciprocity and KS, but has no effect on reputation and KS.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The use of information technology to manage patient consent is an important emerging area of research in health data management. This paper identifies literature, technological advances and current thinking on electronic consent (eConsent). Key issues for Health Care Providers (HCP) and consumers are distilled through a content analysis of a cross section of news reports for the year June 2005-May 2006. For the study we selected countries that are in the process of adopting shared electronic health records, and took the approach of using media analysis. The press is a professional critic as defined by Sauer and Willcocks (2007). The topic of eConsent is closely aligned with issues of information privacy and related legislation, patient rights, and national culture. Clearly, technology is central to the implementation of eConsent and there are pressing management and security issues to be addressed. This paper will make clear the relationships between these fields of study and comment on the 'state of play' in integrated electronic health record systems today, outlining potential pitfalls.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Remanufacturing has gained popularity in recent years due to both environmental necessity and the potential for increased profits. Information systems are key to remanufacturing processes as they can reduce coordination problems and create improved visibility. This is especially important in remanufacturing as the rate of returns and/or demand for remanufactured products can be subject to heavy fluctuations. Many corporate legacy systems do not have the capacity to cope with remanufacturing circumstances and so the prototyped application discussed in this paper provides a cheap alternative to the otherwise heavy investment that would accompany a new ERP product. This paper reports on a case study involving two companies involved in the manufacture and assembly of automotive transmissions. Furthermore, it provides evidence to suggest that the internet can provide a simple and cost-effective solution to significantly improve the information flow between two companies situated in a reverse flow supply chain.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper investigates the question and challenge of knowledge enabling and sharing in distributed organisational environments. On the basis of broad empirical material from action research in two Norwegian companies, we describe and reflect on the development and use of ICT enhanced storytelling as a means to address the challenges above. As a point of departure, we use the learning histories methodology and extend this approach by means of ICT into the realm of purposeful digital storytelling for the support of organisational development. On this background we develop the notions of ''situated support systems'' and ''knowledge hyperstories'', located at the intersection of learning histories proper, cybertext, hyptertext and the web medium.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: E-commerce is a new phenomenon in the financial markets, the growth of which is largely driven by the emergence of the knowledge economy. Due to the nascent development of e-commerce, we hypothesise that new economic issues regarding e-commerce that are emerging have wide macroeconomics, e-commerce stock market and public policy implications. This paper suggests a new approach for analysing the e-commerce stock market relations and issues in terms of macroeconomic factors. This approach uses econometric techniques with some other quantitative methods to address other financial issues in the e-commerce sector. Econometric analyses including stationarity tests, cointegration modelling, including volatility, predictability and efficient market hypothesis checks are performed. The empirical findings of this Australian study and their implications for public policies for other regions are stated.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This study was developed with the objective of examining perceived quality, satisfaction, and customer loyalty in regard to mobile phone service providers. A survey was done involving 434 customers in Brazil. The results showed that perceived quality could be evaluated based on the quality of the product, quality of the connection, shops, coverage areas and customer service. A low level of loyalty was observed and, when the customers' perceived quality increases, they will be more satisfied, more likely to remain with the service provider, to recommend their current provider to others, and to express a lesser desire to switch providers.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Although the world wide web is already about ten years old, it is still a dream that products and services actively serve user's needs. Central market-places with product catalogue metaphors still dominate the internet. This means that market-place participants are required to access, understand and analyse the available offerings before they can interact with other participants or market-place services. Personal business medias start from the position that channels for product and service offerings can be dynamically grouped around the needs of participants so that new and personalised market-place structures can be designed, i.e. market-places come to me at home and speak my language. In contrast to many other approaches, personal data processing is not hosted by a market-place operator but stays with the user. We argue for the position that personal business media provide means to implement open and modular digital media. Finally, with micromarkets a platform is presented which demonstrates how personal business media can be implemented.</abstract>

<title>E-Health readiness framework from Electronic Health Records perspective.</title>

<abstract>Abstract: Electronic Health (E-Health) systems include applications of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) to promote healthcare services support, delivery and education. The success of an E-Health system is very much dependent on the success of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, as EHR forms the core of any E-Health system. Readiness assessment has been identified as an essential requirement for the success of EHR in terms of adoption rate or acceptance. Through a literature review of current E-Health readiness frameworks, it is observed that most studied components reflect healthcare providers' and organisational perspectives but there is an inconsistent coverage of the evaluation components. Further, an unclear measure of readiness levels poses another problem for E-Health readiness assessment. This paper presents an E-Health Readiness Assessment Framework (EHRAF) by integrating components of each reviewed framework and quantifying constructs (a graph-based approach) within the new framework.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This study builds on the existing research on internet adoption in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A research model was postulated to contain three organisational independent variables â company size, financial condition, and technological readiness â that are believed to influence internet adoption within SMEs. Using data from 94 SMEs, technological readiness variables were found to influence the overall measure of internet adoption and four of its components: e-mail use; website sophistication; internet use for marketing support; and internet use for marketing intelligence. Company size was found to be positively related to only the overall internet-adoption measure and none of its components. Financial condition, on the other hand, was found to have no influence on the internet adoption or any of its components. The findings are discussed and implications are explained.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The development of mathematical models is a basic as well as a knowledge-intensive activity of the engineering disciplines and applied sciences. The modelling process involves actions and data that have great influence on the way the implementation of a model can be applied for a particular task, reused (on a component base) or extended. However, much of the corresponding information gets lost. In the area of scientific work, publications and reports are available as complementary information sources for models together with data sources resulting from experimental work used for model development. Concerning models for physico-chemical processes, this information base is, in practice, often not sufficient and cannot be retrieved and accessed in a convenient way. At this point, the well-known methodology of ontology-based information integration provides a promising approach. The basic idea and design principles of ontologies as common data models as well as the idea of information integration is explained. A concept for the enrichment and integration of different information resources concerning mathematical models is described, which combines the documentation of models and the management of related information resources.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This case study explores the change agent roles a manager can play to support an IS specialist when implementing a packaged software. The case concerns a small US-Chinese joint venture, located in China. In part, because of the support roles played by the manager, the IS implementation eventually succeeded. The IS change agent models hypothesised by Markus and Benjamin (l996) serve as a lens to interpret the case. A framework is offered for perceiving how managers can provide change agent support in an IS implementation in general, and in particular in a packaged software implementation in a US-Chinese joint venture. Implications for practitioners and researchers are addressed.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Mobile commerce has experienced tremendous growth in China. We explore the antecedents to mobile service usage based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the decomposed TPB. By examining mobile communication and entertainment service adoption, we find that attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control are determinants of the behavioural intention. Trust and personal innovativeness predict attitude for both services, whereas enjoyment is closely related to attitude in Mobile Entertainment Service (MES) adoption. We also identify differences in the results across the two services examined, indicating separate operational directions for them both theoretically and practically.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: A 'Semantic Portal' is similar to a traditional cyberspace portal, except that web resources are indexed using a rich domain ontology (a specification of key domain concepts) as opposed to, for example, a list of keywords. 'AcOntoWeb' (Accommodation Onto the Web) was originally designed as a website (and web services) package, customised for accommodation enterprises within the T&H sector. It has now been implemented as a semantic portal and, in this paper, we provide an overview of the portal, with an emphasis on cross-portal ontology integration and its powerful query processing capabilities. A survey, assessing the willingness of Australian accommodation enterprise operators to use this new technology, is also presented.</abstract>

<title>Does Culture Matter? Collectivism, Long-Term Orientation, and Supply Chain Management in Korea.</title>

<abstract>Abstract: The existence of a high degree of inter-organisational Long-Term Orientation (LTO) is an important factor for developing a successful relationship among the supply chain members. Within a supply chain, a LTO fosters a better understanding by each exchange party, which in turn leads to a more cooperative relationship. This study introduces one aspect of culture: collectivism, and proposes that a collectivist culture can facilitate the development of a LTO among the members of a supply chain. Collectivism contributes directly by nurturing LTO. It also contributes indirectly by moderating the influence of inter-organisational conflict on LTO.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: We investigate the self-organising behaviour of Digital Ecosystems, because a primary motivation for our research is to exploit the self-organising properties of biological ecosystems. We extended a definition for the complexity, grounded in the biological sciences, providing a measure of the information in an organism's genome. Next, we extended a definition for the stability, originating from the computer sciences, based upon convergence to an equilibrium distribution. Finally, we investigated a definition for the diversity, relative to the selection pressures provided by the user requests. We conclude with a summary and discussion of the achievements, including the experimental results.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The World Wide Web is becoming an increasingly important strategic tool for businesses around the world. The web offers businesses the ability to promote their products, conduct market research, deliver customer services, and sell their products directly to an ever-growing number of internet users worldwide. However, very little is known about how businesses should strategically leverage the capabilities of this new medium. This article presents the results of an empirical study of the Miles and Snow typology to describe the strategies of small businesses involved in web-based electronic commerce. The results demonstrate that the Miles and Snow typology can be extended to the realm of electronic commerce and that the strategies followed by online businesses are consistent with previous empirical findings. Furthermore, the results lend further support to the validity and usefulness of the typology and to the concept of co-alignment.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This study integrates service fairness into a post-acceptance model of information system continuance. This study added constructs based on Greenberg's (1993) four-component taxonomy of organisational justice. The research model seeks to be useful in predicting post-acceptance satisfaction, which enhances continued usage of services together with a technological product. The results show that perceived usefulness and satisfaction influence continuance intention, as the post-acceptance model predicts. Three of the four distinct service fairness dimensions, systemic, configural and interpersonal fairness significantly enhanced post-acceptance satisfaction. However, the relationship between informational fairness and satisfaction was negative and significant.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Supply chain management information systems (SCM IS) have become vital tools for synchronising information among the customers and suppliers of a supply chain. However, recent advances in inter-enterprise systems and e-business technologies have led to a confusing variety of SCM IS alternatives, each with varying capabilities. This paper demonstrates how a business unit's competitive strategy patterns can be identified and used to determine the levels of support an SCM IS should provide to enable operational efficiency, flexibility, and planning and analysis capabilities. An exploratory pilot study using the emergent model illustrates its utility and assesses various measures of its operationalisation.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This research attempted to review the E-Commerce (EC) strategy of the New Zealand (NZ) government in the light of recent EC adoption and diffusion research in Small- to Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in NZ. This was an important objective in this research in order to highlight commonalities and differences between the determinants of EC adoption in SMEs and the EC strategy of the NZ government. Addressing implications arising from these comparisons was another objective in this research. The research found that the NZ EC strategy managed to address most of the impending issues concerning EC success in NZ in the long term. However, this research contended that for EC to succeed in SMEs in NZ, some of these strategies needed to be addressed and executed first.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The aim of this paper is to deliver insight into enterprise transformation planning incorporating Enterprise Architecture (EA) models. The paper is based on analytically developed approaches to model-based enterprise transformation planning and uses six case studies to evaluate and extend the existing planning processes. To understand the planning situations and their respective planning processes, we cluster the observed processes and link them to empirically derived EA realisation forms. Thus, the resulting process model induced from our empirical observations can be tailored to fit specific needs of an organisation depending on its realisation form of EA.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: Safety hazard identification is an important task in preventing accidents. If a safety hazard is not identified, the necessary action to remove, reduce or control the hazard cannot be undertaken. This paper discusses the practice of safety hazard identification and its problems in construction projects, such as method of safety hazard identification used and the time required for this. One of the most obvious problems is that, in construction projects, safety hazard identification is conducted by site inspections during the construction stage. This leads to an inadequate amount of time to conduct a risk assessment study in order to control the hazard identified. The potential benefits of using VR to overcome the problems were investigated. VR can be used to represent the construction project at the completion of the design stage. By using the safety database, which is also developed in this study, the VR representation can be analysed to identify possible safety hazards and to assign preventive measures at the completion of design stage (before the construction stage). The result of this investigation and some solutions to technical problems are discussed.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: This paper gives a systematic analysis of a special group of multi-person games. By assuming linear payoff functions, the order of magnitude of four parameters determines the type of the games. In our study we fix three parameters and systematically vary the fourth one. In this way we can obtain the battle of sexes, the benevolent chicken, the chicken and the maximising differences games. Our systematic approach is based on agent based simulation. It presents the varying characteristics of the different games as well as it shows how the transitions are made from one game to another.</abstract>

<title>The impact of consumption emotions of standby customers on customer satisfaction: an empirical analysis from Chinese customers.</title>

<year>2013</year>
<volume>8</volume>
<journal>International Journal of Internet and Enterprise Management</journal>

<abstract>Abstract: In recent years, as the traditional cognitive model cannot fully explain the degree of customer satisfaction, western scholars started to incorporate the consumption emotions into the cognitive model which has developed the current dominant customer satisfaction cognition-emotion model, a dominant method. However, divergences exist in the research conclusions about the discrepancy between emotion and expectation disconfirmation and how they influence the customer satisfaction. Some scholars hold that the divergences resulted from the ignorance of different timing (before consumption, in consumption and after consumption) of emotion measurement. The author focused on the customers who are waiting for banking services to study the interaction of the disagreed customer emotions before consumption and expectations in consumption as well as their influence on customer satisfaction. The author verify the influence with the help of description experiment method, in hope of being beneficial to the improvement of customer satisfaction theories and providing the banking industry an idea to increase service quality.</abstract>

<abstract>Abstract: The global trend of e-commerce and use of information technology is transforming the business structure of many industries, and the air cargo industry is no exception. The requirement for information integration is unprecedented in the air cargo industry. The Hong Kong Government (via Airport Authority) has initiated efforts to establish a high-tech logistics centre, which could allow the leasing of both information infrastructure and physical facilities without requirement of ownership. Like any public infrastructure project, a vast amount of investment is required and there is a vast amount of risk involved as well. The success of such a centre depends on the commitment of three parties the Hong Kong Government, the investors, and the users. While each party plays an important role towards the centre's success, their interests might differ and in some cases be conflicting. In this paper, we evaluate the benefits, costs, and risks of such a logistic centre using a series of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and analytic network process (ANP) models. It is shown that the proposed models can be used to examine the sharing of benefits, costs and risks such that a design agreeable to all parties can be determined.</abstract>
