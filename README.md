Web Semantic Project

In order to work, you need to have lucene-5.4.0 and stanford-corenlp on your computer. Drag the folders in the lib folder or modify the file .classpath in the main folder.

If you have 'wget' and 'unzip' installed on your machine, just run 'script_lib.sh', it will care of everything.

The project can be easily imported in eclipse with the egit extension.
